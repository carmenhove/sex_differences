  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is generally acknowledged that autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in females worldwide. These diseases are caused by interaction of genetic and environmental factors that result in the failure of immune mechanisms responsible for self-tolerance. One of these mechanisms includes regulatory T cells which play an essential role in maintaining peripheral tolerance. These cells are a subset of CD4+ helper T cells which express high levels of CD25 on their surface. These cells suppress cells of both innate and adaptive immune systems in an antigen nonspecific manner through cell-cell contact and production of cytokines. As females have a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases and regulatory T cells play a crucial role in preventing autoimmunity, it was reasonable to hypothesize that the females might have a lower number of T(reg) as compared to males. METHODS: 50 apparently healthy males and 47 females aged 19 - 26 years were recruited for the study. The percentage of regulatory T cells in their peripheral blood was determined using flow cytometery. Mann Whitney rank sum test was applied to estimate the significance of gender related difference in their frequency. RESULTS: Significant difference was observed in regulatory T cells percentages of males and females, p {$<$} 0.02 showing that there is a lower regulatory T cell percentage in females than in males (2.89 +/- 1.46\% vs. 3.32 +/- 1.39\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significant difference in the frequency of regulatory T cells among males and females which could be one of the reasons for increased predisposition of females to autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} To determine the gender differences in neonatal mortality, stillbirths, and perinatal mortality in south Asia using the Global Network data from the Maternal Newborn Health Registry. Methods:{\enspace} This study is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from the three south Asian sites of the Global Network. The maternal and neonatal demographic, clinical characteristics, rates of stillbirths, early neonatal mortality (1--7 days), late neonatal mortality (8--28 days), mortality between 29--42 days and the number of infants hospitalized after birth were compared between the male and female infants. Results:{\enspace} Between 2010 and 2018, 297,509 births [154,790 males (52.03\%) and 142,719 females (47.97\%)] from two Indian sites and one Pakistani site were included in the analysis [288,859 live births (97.1\%) and 8,648 stillbirths (2.9\%)]. The neonatal mortality rate was significantly higher in male infants (33.2/1,000 live births) compared to their female counterparts (27.4/1,000, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The rates of stillbirths (31.0 vs. 26.9/1000 births) and early neonatal mortality (27.1 vs 21.6/1000 live births) were also higher in males. However, there were no significant differences in late neonatal mortality (6.3 vs. 5.9/1000 live births) and mortality between 29--42 days (2.1 vs. 1.9/1000 live births) between the two groups. More male infants were hospitalized within 42 days after birth (1.8/1000 vs. 1.3/1000 live births, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) than females. Conclusion:{\enspace} The risks of stillbirths, and early neonatal mortality were higher among male infants than their female counterparts. However, there was no gender difference in mortality after 7 days of age. Our results highlight the importance of stratifying neonatal mortality into early and late neonatal period to better understand the impact of gender on neonatal mortality. The information from this study will help in developing strategies and identifying measures that can reduce differences in sex-specific mortality.},

However, distinct inequality remains, as child mortality rates are generally found to be higher in males. A significant proportion of childhood deaths in the UK occur in Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU). We studied the association of sex with infant mortality in PICUs. We included all infants (0 to 12~months old) admitted to UK PICUs from 01/01/2005 to 31/12/2015 using the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) dataset. We considered first admissions to PICU and fitted a cause-specific-hazard-ratio (CSHR) model, and a logistic model to estimate the adjusted association between sex and mortality in PICU. Pre-defined subgroups were children less than 56-days old, and those with a primary diagnosis of infection. Of 71,243 cases, 1,411/29,520 (4.8\%) of females, and 1,809/41,723 (4.3\%) of males died. The adjusted male/female CSHR was 0.87 (95\%-CI 0.81 to 0.92) representing a 13\% higher risk of death for females. The adjusted OR for male to female mortality is 0.86 (95\%-CI 0.80 to 0.93). Analyses in subgroups yielded similar findings. In our analysis, female infants have a higher rate of PICU mortality compared to male infants.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Relative to industrialized populations, men from subsistence groups exhibit lower testosterone values and more modest declines with age. Limited energy availability has been hypothesized to suppress testosterone production, particularly during young adulthood when testosterone levels are highest, resulting in a flatter trajectory of age-decline. Energetic constraint, however, is not unique to the evolutionary ecology of humans, and yet significant age-related testosterone decline is observed in numerous species of wild primates. Conversely, human life history is distinguished by extensive bi-parental care and male provisioning. Because fathers show decreased testosterone with parenting effort, we argue that within more naturalistic and evolutionarily relevant ecologies, natural fertility and earlier reproduction suppresses testosterone in emerging adulthood such that a lower relative baseline dictates less age-decline across the remaining lifespan. Methods: We examine men's testosterone levels as contrasting functions of energetic status and paternal involvement across three traditional populations with substantial variability in men's nutritional condition and parental investment. Anthropometric and demographic data along with saliva samples were collected from 70 Datoga, 29 Hadza, and 43 Qom men, ages 20--72 years. Results: Population variation in salivary testosterone was greatest at younger ages and patterned so paternal involvement associated with lower morning and evening testosterone, along with diminished age-decline in both measures. Men's energetic status as indicated by body mass index was not associated with testosterone values or age-related decline. Conclusions: Within socioecological contexts of smaller scale society, these data suggest that blunted age-decline in men's testosterone levels is primarily due to population variation in parental investment rather than energetic constraint.},

These disorders cause the immune system to cause a systemic reaction by attacking multiple organs or may be localized to attacking one specific organ, such as the skin. The exact mechanism of such autoimmune conditions is not well understood; however, the presumed mechanism tends to vary amongst the disorders. Autoimmune diseases present with a clear gender bias with a greater prevalence amongst women, occurring at a rate of 2 to 1. Many autoimmune disorders tend to affect women during periods of extensive stress, such as pregnancy, or during a great hormonal change. A far greater number of women are affected every year with autoimmune diseases, leading to researchers attempting to identify the underlying factors, which could be responsible for this disparity. Autoimmune disorders occur as a result of multiple factors as some disorders may be genetic, while others are sporadic. Throughout this review, various hypotheses are explored that provide insight into the increased susceptibility of autoimmune disorders within women.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Pregnancy represents a period when the mother undergoes significant immunological changes to promote tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft. Such tolerance results from the exposure of the maternal immune system to fetal antigens (Ags), a process that has been widely investigated at the maternal-fetal interface and in the adjacent draining lymph nodes. However, the peripheral mechanisms of maternal-fetal crosstalk are poorly understood. Herein, we hypothesized that specific innate immune cells interact with fetal Ags in the maternal circulation. To test this hypothesis, a mouse model was utilized in which transgenic male mice expressing the chicken ovalbumin (OVA) Ag under the beta-actin promoter were allogeneically mated with wild-type females to allow for tracking of the fetal Ag. Fetal Ag-carrying Ly6G+ and F4/80+ cells were identified in the maternal circulation, where they were more abundant in the second half of pregnancy. Such innate immune cells displayed unique phenotypes: while Ly6G+ cells expressed high levels of MHC-II and CD80 together with low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, F4/80+ cells up-regulated the expression of CD86 as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-{$\beta$}. In vitro studies using allogeneic GFP+ placental particles revealed that maternal peripheral Ly6G+ and F4/80+ cells phagocytose fetal Ags in mid and late murine pregnancy. Importantly, cytotrophoblast-derived particles were also engulfed in vitro by CD15+ and CD14+ cells from women in the second and third trimester, providing translational evidence that this process also occurs in humans. Collectively, this study demonstrates novel interactions between specific maternal circulating innate immune cells and fetal Ags, thereby shedding light on the systemic mechanisms of maternal-fetal crosstalk.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Recent increases in infectious disease mortality and concern about emerging infections warrant an examination of longer-term trends. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in infectious disease mortality in the United States during the 20th century. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study of infectious disease mortality in the United States. Deaths due to infectious diseases from 1900 to 1996 were tallied by using mortality tables. Trends in age-specific infectious disease mortality were examined by using age-specific death rates for 9 common infectious causes of death. SUBJECTS: Persons who died in the United States between 1900 and 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates. RESULTS: Infectious disease mortality declined during the first 8 decades of the 20th century from 797 deaths per 100000 in 1900 to 36 deaths per 100000 in 1980. From 1981 to 1995, the mortality rate increased to a peak of 63 deaths per 100000 in 1995 and declined to 59 deaths per 100000 in 1996. The decline was interrupted by a sharp spike in mortality caused by the 1918 influenza epidemic. From 1938 to 1952, the decline was particularly rapid, with mortality decreasing 8.2\% per year. Pneumonia and influenza were responsible for the largest number of infectious disease deaths throughout the century. Tuberculosis caused almost as many deaths as pneumonia and influenza early in the century, but tuberculosis mortality dropped off sharply after 1945. Infectious disease mortality increased in the 1980s and early 1990s in persons aged 25 years and older and was mainly due to the emergence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 25- to 64-year-olds and, to a lesser degree, to increases in pneumonia and influenza deaths among persons aged 65 years and older. There was considerable year-to-year variability in infectious disease mortality, especially for the youngest and oldest age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the 20th century has been marked by declining infectious disease mortality, substantial year-to-year variation as well as recent increases emphasize the dynamic nature of infectious diseases and the need for preparedness to address them},

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare circulating levels of maternal hormones affecting breast differentiation (human chorionic gonadotropin and prolactin) and proliferation [{$\alpha$}-fetoprotein, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and estradiol] between women at a low to moderate risk (Asians and Hispanics), as compared with women at a high risk for breast cancer (Caucasians and African-Americans). Between May 2002 and December 2004, a total of 586 pregnant women were approached during a routine prenatal visit. Among them, 450 women (206 Caucasian, 126 Asian, 88 Hispanic, and 30 African-American) met the inclusion criteria and signed the informed consent. Only singleton pregnancies were considered. Blood samples were drawn during the second trimester of pregnancy. Laboratory analyses were done using the IMMULITE 2000 immunoassay system. Gestational age standardized mean levels of estradiol, IGF-I, and prolactin were significantly higher in Hispanic women compared with Caucasian women. Mean concentration of IGF-I was significantly higher in African-American women compared with Caucasian and Asian women. No significant differences in pregnancy hormone levels were observed between Caucasian and Asian (predominantly second-generation Chinese) women in this study. Irrespective of ethnicity, women who had their first pregnancy had substantially higher mean levels of {$\alpha$}-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, estradiol, and prolactin compared with women who previously had at least one full-term pregnancy. These data suggest that circulating pregnancy hormone levels may explain some of the ethnic differences in breast cancer risk. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2006;15(11):2123--30)},

  abstract = {The differences between males and females begin shortly after birth, continue throughout prenatal development, and eventually extend into childhood and adult life. Male embryos and fetuses prioritize proliferation and growth, often at the expense of the fetoplacental energy reserves. This singular focus on growth over adaptability leaves male fetuses and neonates vulnerable to adverse outcomes during pregnancy and birth and can have lasting impacts throughout life. Beyond this prioritization of growth, male placentas and fetuses also respond to infection and inflammation differently than female counterparts. Pregnancies carrying female fetuses have a more regulatory immune response, whereas pregnancies carrying male fetuses have a stronger inflammatory response. These differences can be seen as early as the innate immune response with differences in cytokine and chemokine signaling. The sexual dimorphism in immunity then continues into the adaptive immune response with differences in T-cell biology and antibody production and transfer. As it appears that these sex-specific differences are amplified in pathologic pregnancies, it stands to reason that differences in the placental, fetal, and maternal immune responses in pregnancy contribute to increased male perinatal morbidity and mortality. In this review, we will describe the genetic and hormonal contributions to the sexual dimorphism of fetal and placental immunity. We will also discuss current research efforts to describe the sex-specific differences of the maternal--fetal interface and how it impacts fetal and maternal health.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in stress responses can be found at all stages of life and are related to both the organizational and activational effects of gonadal hormones and to genes on the sex chromosomes. As stress dysregulation is the most common feature across neuropsychiatric diseases, sex differences in how these pathways develop and mature may predict sex-specific periods of vulnerability to disruption and increased disease risk or resilience across the lifespan. The aging brain is also at risk to the effects of stress, where the rapid decline of gonadal hormones in women combined with cellular aging processes promote sex biases in stress dysregulation. In this Review, we discuss potential underlying mechanisms driving sex differences in stress responses and their relevance to disease. Although stress is involved in a much broader range of diseases than neuropsychiatric ones, we highlight here this area and its examples across the lifespan. Maintenance of homeostasis depends on the tight orchestration of factors involved in the response to stress and its recovery, where sex differences exist at all levels. Regulation of the stress axis involves the coordination between multiple brain regions guiding the magnitude of the stress response as well as the negative feedback necessary for its return to baseline. At its most fundamental level, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis is driven by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) that upon stress activation release CRF into the hypophyseal portal circulation. CRF activation of corticotrope cells in the anterior pituitary results in a release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the general circulation to activate melanocortin-2 receptors in the adrenal gland cortex, which activates the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids 1,2. These glucocorticoids, largely through binding of the},

We provide an overview of accumulating data during physiological and pathological conditions and discuss currently conceptualized theories on how sex hormones potentially trigger neuroplasticity changes through these four neurochemical systems. Many brain regions have been demonstrated to express high densities for estrogen- and progesterone receptors, such as the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampus. As the hippocampus is of particular relevance in the context of mediating structural plasticity in the adult brain, we put particular emphasis on what evidence could be gathered thus far that links differences in behavior, neurochemical patterns and hippocampal structure to a changing hormonal environment.

Far from the initial view of pregnancy as a state of immunosuppression, successful fetal development from implantation to birth is now known to be under the control of an intricate balance of immune cells. The balance between pro-inflammatory functions used to promote embryo implantation and placental development and immunosuppressive activity to maintain maternal tolerance of the fetus is an immunological phenotype unique to pregnancy, which is dependent on the time of gestation. Neutrophils are one of a host of innate immune cells detected at the maternal--fetal interface, but very little is known of their function. In this review, we explore the emerging functions of neutrophils during pregnancy and their interactions with and regulation of T cells, a key adaptive immune cell population essential for the establishment of fetal--maternal tolerance.},

Hematological markers can be considered as a direct reflection of the systemic inflammatory milieu. Recently, the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio has been explored for its potential to assess the severity of inflammation and thus the severity of the underlying disorder. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio has gained scientific attention as a potential prognostic/predictive marker of acute as well as chronic inflammatory diseases including gynecological and reproductive disorders. This present study reviews the mechanistic role of neutrophils and lymphocytes in fueling or propagating the inflammatory cascades in the three most common maternal complications of pregnancy and the evidence of clinical importance of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in predicting, diagnosing, and prognosticating pregnancy-associated complications.},

  abstract = {The fetal hypothalamus-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis begins to function during midgestation but its activity decreases during late pregnancy due to the suppressive effects of placental estrogens. Placental hormones drop immediately after birth, FSH and LH surge at around 1 week and peak between 1 and 3 months of life. The HPG axis is activated in both sexes, but a sexual dimorphism is evident with higher LH values in boys, while FSH prevails in girls. Both gonadotrophins decline in boys by around 6 months of age. In girls, LH declines at the same time as in boys, while FSH persists elevated up to 3 or 4 years of age. As a result of gonadotropin activation, testicular testosterone increases in males and ovarian estradiol rises in females. These events clinically translate into testicular and penile growth in boys, enlargement of uterus and breasts in girls. The functional impact of HPG axis activity in infancy on later reproductive function is uncertain. According to the perinatal programming theory, this period may represent an essential programming process. In boys, long-term testicular hormonal function and spermatogenesis seem to be, at least in part, regulated by minipuberty. On the contrary, the role of minipuberty in girls is still uncertain. Recently, androgen exposure during minipuberty has been correlated with later sex-typed behavior. Premature and/or SGA infants show significant differences in postnatal HPG axis activity in comparison to full-term infants and the consequences of these differences on later health and disease require further research. The sex-dimorphic HPG activation during mid-gestation is probably responsible for the body composition differences observed ad birth between boys and girls, with boys showing greater total body mass and lean mass, and a lower proportion of fat mass. Testosterone exposure during minipuberty further contributes to these differences and seems to be responsible for the significantly higher growth velocity observed in male infants. Lastly, minipuberty is a valuable ``window of opportunity'' for differential diagnosis of disorders of sex development and it represents the only time window before puberty when congenital hypogonadism can be diagnosed by the simple analysis of basal gonadotropin and gonadal hormone levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The peak shift model predicts that the age-profile of a pathogen's prevalence depends upon its transmission rate, peaking earlier in populations with higher transmission and declining as partial immunity is acquired. Helminth infections are associated with increased immunoglobulin E (IgE), which may convey partial immunity and influence the peak shift. Although studies have noted peak shifts in helminths, corresponding peak shifts in total IgE have not been investigated, nor has the age-patterning been carefully examined across populations. We test for differences in the age-patterning of IgE between two South American forager-horticulturalist populations and the United States: the Tsimane of Bolivia (n=832), the Shuar of Ecuador (n=289), and the U.S. NHANES (n=8,336). We then examine the relationship between total IgE and helminth prevalences in the Tsimane. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total IgE levels were assessed in serum and dried blood spots and age-patterns examined with non-linear regression models. Tsimane had the highest IgE (geometric mean =8,182 IU/ml), followed by Shuar (1,252 IU/ml), and NHANES (52 IU/ml). Consistent with predictions, higher population IgE was associated with steeper increases at early ages and earlier peaks: Tsimane IgE peaked at 7 years, Shuar at 10 years, and NHANES at 17 years. For Tsimane, the age-pattern was compared with fecal helminth prevalences. Overall, 57\% had detectable eggs or larva, with hookworm (45.4\%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (19.9\%) the most prevalent. The peak in total IgE occurred around the peak in A. lumbricoides, which was associated with higher IgE in children {$<$}10, but with lower IgE in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The age-patterning suggests a peak shift in total IgE similar to that seen in helminth infections, particularly A. lumbricoides. This age-patterning may have implications for understanding the effects of helminths on other health outcomes, such as allergy, growth, and response to childhood vaccination.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects were 6338 Tsimane aged 0-90 years.

Flow cytometry was used to quantify na{\"i}ve and non-na{\"i}ve CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. RESULTS Compared to reference populations, Tsimane have elevated levels of most immunological parameters, particularly immunoglobulins, eosinophils, ESR, B cells, and natural killer cells. However, monocytes and basophils are reduced and na{\"i}ve CD4 cells depleted in older age groups. CONCLUSION Tsimane ecology leads to lymphocyte repertoires and immunoglobulin profiles that differ from those observed in industrialised populations.

Aims: To review the burden of allergic and infectious diseases and the evidence for a link to microbial exposure, the human microbiome and immune system, and to assess whether we could develop lifestyles which reconnect us with exposures which could reduce the risk of allergic disease while also protecting against infectious disease. Methods: Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim. Results: Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe-host interactions, the term 'hygiene hypothesis' is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures. Conclusion: Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term 'hygiene hypothesis' must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease.},

This phenotypic plasticity can be mediated by transcriptional and epigenetic variability. Results: We apply a novel analytical approach to measure and compare transcriptional and epigenetic variability genome-wide across CD14+CD16- monocytes, CD66b+CD16+ neutrophils, and CD4+CD45RA+ na{\"i}ve T cells from the same 125 healthy individuals. We discover substantially increased variability in neutrophils compared to monocytes and T cells. In neutrophils, genes with hypervariable expression are found to be implicated in key immune pathways and are associated with cellular properties and environmental exposure. We also observe increased sex-specific gene expression differences in neutrophils. Neutrophil-specific DNA methylation hypervariable sites are enriched at dynamic chromatin regions and active enhancers. Conclusions: Our data highlight the importance of transcriptional and epigenetic variability for the key role of neutrophils as the first responders to inflammatory stimuli.

This results in a sexual dimorphism in the immune response in humans: for instance, females produce more vigorous cellular and more vigorous humoral immune reactions, are more resistant to certain infections, and suffer a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases. Disease expression is also affected by the reproductive status of the female. As sex steroids--estrogens, progesterone and testosterone--differ between gender and within different reproductive stages, a lot of research has focussed on the effects of sex hormones on immune responses. Although there is also a vast literature on the effects of sex hormones on immune responses in animals, in this review we will focus on the most intriguing effects and mechanisms by which sex hormones affect different components of the immune system in humans.},

  abstract = {Objective: To test whether 17␤-estradiol or progesterone influence the cytokine productive capacity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes in humans. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Academic research institution. Patient(s): Seven women in the luteal phase of a normal ovarian cycle, 13 oral contraceptive users, 10 men, and 10 postmenopausal women. Intervention(s): Blood samples collected from women in the luteal phase and from oral contraceptive users were used to study the in vivo effect of 17␤-estradiol and progesterone on monocyte cytokine production. Blood samples collected from men and postmenopausal women were used for in vitro incubation with 17␤-estradiol and progesterone. Main Outcome Measure(s): The percentage of monocytes producing tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) and interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤) after in vitro LPS-stimulation was determined. Result(s): No in vivo relation in the productive capacities of LPS-stimulated monocytes in the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle was found between progesterone and TNF-␣ or IL-1␤; or between 17␤-estradiol and TNF-␣ or IL-1␤. Moreover, the production of TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ by LPS-stimulated monocytes did not vary between periods of oral contraceptive use and nonuse. The production of TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ by LPS-stimulated monocytes in the blood of men and postmenopausal women in vitro was not influenced by incubation with different concentrations of 17␤-estradiol or progesterone. Conclusion(s): We could not find evidence for a causal relationship between 17␤-estradiol or progesterone and TNF-␣- or IL-1␤-production. We conclude that 17␤-estradiol and progesterone do not influence the cytokine-production capacity of LPS-stimulated monocytes in humans.

The study population consisted of adult Ach{\'e} hunter-gatherer males (n = 45) living in eastern Paraguay. Morning and evening salivary testosterone levels (Tsal A.M.; Tsal P.M.) among the Ach{\'e} were considerably lower than western values (Boston) and even lower than other previously reported nonwestern populations (Efe, Lese, Nepalese). No association was observed between height, weight, or age and salivary testosterone levels within the Ach{\'e} group, although older men (ages {$>$} 40) were poorly represented in the study sample. Nevertheless, a mild correlation was observed between Ach{\'e} Tsal A.M. levels and BMI (r = 0.133, p = 0.0725). Comparison of Ach{\'e} values with those for other populations confirms the prevalence of significant interpopulational variation in testosterone levels among adult males. Interpopulational variation in male testosterone is not as great, however, as has been documented for ovarian steroids among females, nor is it likely that such variation reflects differences in male fecundity. Nevertheless, such interpopulational variation in salivary testosterone levels may have a functional significance in the regulation of protein anabolism in skeletal muscle, thereby affecting the overall energy budget of the organism. It is suggested that relative suppression of average testosterone may be adaptive under conditions of chronic energy shortage.},

Monocytes were isolated by negative selection, and gene expression studied by RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analysis. A computational model that incorporated case/control status, sex, and the interaction between case/control status and sex was utilized. We found that there was a striking effect of sex on monocyte gene expression. There was inflammatory activation of monocytes in females with PD, with enrichment of gene sets associated with interferon gamma stimulation. In males, the activation patterns were more heterogeneous. These data point to the importance of systemic monocyte activation in PD, and the importance of studies which examine the differential effects of sex on pathophysiology of the disease.},

In vitro studies of human lymphoid cells also show sex differences in immune function. To evaluate these differences in frequent pediatric emergencies, we analyze the expression of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and neutrophil count) underlying inflammatory processes in children: 482 children (241 girls and 241 boys) hospitalized for pneumonia (n = 384), pyelonephritis (n = 39), or bronchiolitis (n = 59) matched for age and sex. All patients were younger than 10 years. A control population of 97 children (50 girls and 47 boys) admitted for day surgery (tonsillectomy, circumcision, or strabismus) was included. We observed highly significant differences between girls and boys: median C-reactive protein concentration of 5.45 mg/dL (range, 0.2Y36.0 mg/dL) for girls and 2.6 mg/dL (range, 0.3Y37.3 mg/dL) for boys (P G 0.0001), and median erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 39.5 mm/h (range, 2Y104 mm/h) for girls and 24 mm/h (range, 4Y140 mm/h) for boys (P G 0.005). Neutrophil counts were also significantly different: a median of 8,796 cells/2L (range, 328Y27,645 cells/2L) for girls and 6,774 cells/2L (range, 600Y38,668 cells/2L) for boys (P G 0.02). The duration of fever after initiating antibiotic therapy was longer in girls than in boys, but there was no difference (Fisher exact test, P G 0.06). The present study documents a relationship between sex and both the production of inflammatory markers and neutrophil recruitment. Sex difference also showed more direct clinical relevance with associations seen between sex and both duration of fever and duration of disease (bronchiolitis P G 0.0007).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The non-stress test (NST) is the most widely used tool for fetal assessment. The proportion of fetuses that are reactive (two 15 bpm x 15 sec accelerations in 20 minutes) is gestational age dependent with as many as 50\% of 24-28wk fetuses having a false positive test. Recent NICHD criteria defines reassuring fetal heart rate accelerations Ͻ32 weeks as 10 bpm over the baseline ϫ 10 sec. There is limited data to support this alternate definition. We sought to determine whether ``preterm'' reactive criteria (two 10 bpm ϫ 10 sec accelerations in 20 minutes) for NSTs between 24-32 weeks gestation correlates with a reassuring biophysical profile (BPP). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of antenatal patients undergoing BPP. Singleton, non-anomalous pregnancies from 24 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks with a paired NST and BPP were included. Medical records and fetal heart rate strips were reviewed. Maternal demographics, antenatal complications, and indications for testing were abstracted. Each NST was reviewed and designated as reactive or nonreactive based on ``preterm'' or ``traditional'' criteria and the BPP score recorded. Agreement between traditional and preterm reactive NST and a reassuring BPP (8) was assessed with McNemar's test. RESULTS: We identified 57 NST-BPP pairs. Preterm reactive NSTs were highly correlated with a reassuring BPP (McNemar pϽ0.04, Spearman 0.6) with PPV 94\% and NPV 44\%. Term reactive NSTs were moderately correlated with reassuring BPP (McNemar pϽ0.001, Spearman 0.4) with a PPV 93\% and NPV 33\%. The false positive rate for traditional reactive NST's was significantly higher compared to preterm reactive NST's. CONCLUSION: Preterm reactive criteria for fetuses 24-32 weeks gestation correlates well with a reassuring BPP and has a lower false positive rate compared to traditional reactive criteria. This criteria may lead to fewer unnecessary BPP's in healthy fetuses between 24-32 weeks.},

Neutrophil depletion in primed mice abrogated the protective effects of transferred macrophages and inhibited their in vitro binding to larvae. Neutrophils in parasite-infected mice showed a distinct transcriptional profile and promoted alternatively activated M2 macrophage polarization through secretory factors including IL-13. Differentially activated neutrophils in the context of a type 2 immune response therefore prime a long-lived effector macrophage phenotype that directly mediates rapid nematode damage and clearance.},

There have been conflicting reports on whether systemic inflammatory markers have predictive value for thyroid cancers. We aimed to evaluate the association between systemic inflammatory markers and clinicopathological factors in thyroid cancers and to assess their predictive value for thyroid cancers in detail. Five hundred thirty-one patients who underwent surgery for thyroid nodules were included. The patient population consisted of 99 individuals (18.6\%) with benign thyroid nodules and 432 individuals (81.4\%) with thyroid cancers. In 432 patients with thyroid cancers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in the cases with tumors greater than 2 cm than in those with tumors less than 2 cm. (p = 0.027). NLR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were significantly higher in cases with lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) than in those without LNM (p = 0.007 and 0.090, respectively). The nodule size was significantly higher in benign thyroid nodules than in thyroid cancers (p {$<$} 0.001). When the cases were stratified by tumor size, NLR was a significant predictor of thyroid cancers in cases with nodules greater than 2 cm (Exp(B) = 1.85, 95\% CI = 1.15--2.97, p = 0.011), but not in those with nodules less than 2 cm. In thyroid cancers, preoperative NLR was associated with pathological prognosticators such as tumor size and lateral lymph node metastasis. When the size difference between thyroid cancers and benign thyroid nodules was adjusted, NLR could be a significant predictor of thyroid cancers.},

This Special Issue of Nutrients explores the relationship between diet and nutrients and immune function. In this preface, we outline the key functions of the immune system, and how it interacts with nutrients across the life course, highlighting the work included within this Special Issue. This includes the role of macronutrients, micronutrients, and the gut microbiome in mediating immunological effects. Nutritional modulation of the immune system has applications within the clinical setting, but can also have a role in healthy populations, acting to reduce or delay the onset of immune-mediated chronic diseases. Ongoing research in this field will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the role of diet and nutrients in immune function and will facilitate the use of bespoke nutrition to improve human health.},

Previous studies reported a peak in hormone concentrations at 3 to 4 months old. Our objective is to describe anti-M{\"u}llerian hormone (AMH) trajectories in the context of other minipuberty factors among healthy infant girls using longitudinal measures of AMH.                                         Methods:               The Infant Feeding and Early Development study is a longitudinal cohort study of healthy infants, recruited from hospitals in the Philadelphia area during 2010 to 2013. We measured AMH in 153 girls who contributed 1366 serum samples across 11 study visits over 36 weeks. We also measured follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, and ovarian characteristics. We used latent class mixed effects models to cluster trajectories of AMH concentration with age. Using linear mixed models, we estimated FSH and ovarian characteristic trajectories separately by AMH cluster.                                         Results:               We classified infants into four clusters that represent patterns of AMH that were high and decreasing (decreasing), had a peak around 12 weeks or 20 weeks (early peak and middle peak), or were consistently low (low). Infants in these clusters differed in their FSH trajectories, timing of estradiol production, and ovarian characteristics.                                         Conclusions:               The AMH clusters identified suggest variation in the timing and the magnitude of the minipuberty response in infant girls. The decreasing and low clusters have not been described previously and should be further evaluated to determine whether they represent an opportunity for the early identification of later reproductive conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mortality rates in the United States fell more rapidly during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries than in any other period in American history. This decline coincided with an epidemiological transition and the disappearance of a mortality ``penalty'' associated with living in urban areas. There is little empirical evidence and much unresolved debate about what caused these improvements, however. In this article, we report the causal influence of clean water technologies--- filtration and chlorination---on mortality in major cities during the early twentieth century. Plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of technology adoption was used to identify these effects, and the validity of this identifying assumption is examined in detail. We found that clean water was responsible for nearly half the total mortality reduction in major cities, three quarters of the infant mortality reduction, and nearly two thirds of the child mortality reduction. Rough calculations suggest that the social rate of return to these technologies was greater than 23 to 1, with a cost per person-year saved by clean water of about \$500 in 2003 dollars. Implications for developing countries are briefly considered.},

Methods: This is a retrospective study in relapsing--remitting MS patients (RRMS) admitted to the tertiary MS center of Catania, Italy during the period of 1 January to 31 December 2018. The aim of the present study was to investigate the significance of the NLR in reflecting the disease activity in a cohort of early diagnosed RRMS patients. Results: Among a total sample of 132 patients diagnosed with RRMS, 84 were enrolled in the present study. In the association analysis, a relation between the NLR value and disease activity at onset was found (V-Cramer 0.271, p = 0.013). In the logistic regression model, the variable NLR (p = 0.03 ExpB 3.5, CI 95\% 1.089--11.4) was related to disease activity at onset. Conclusion: An elevated NLR is associated with disease activity at onset in RRMS patients. More large-scale studies with a longer follow-up are needed.},

  abstract = {Acute viral respiratory infections are the main infectious disease in the world. In 2020, a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global pandemic. The immune response to the virus depends on factors such as genetics, age and physical state, and its main input receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The practice of physical exercises acts as a modulator of the immune system. During and after physical exercise, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released, lymphocyte circulation increases, as well as cell recruitment. Such practice has an effect on the lower incidence, intensity of symptoms and mortality in viral infections observed in people who practice physical activity regularly, and its correct execution must be considered to avoid damage. The initial response is given mainly by type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive the action macrophages and lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte action. A suppression of the IFN-I response has been noted in COVID-19. Severe conditions have been associated with storms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia, as well as circulatory changes and virus dispersion to other organs. The practice of physical activities strengthens the immune system, suggesting a benefit in the response to viral communicable diseases. Thus, regular practice of adequate intensity is suggested as an auxiliary tool in strengthening and preparing the immune system for COVID-19. Further studies are needed to associate physical exercise with SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

In men the slow, physiological decline of serum testosterone (T) with advancing age overlaps with the clinical condition of overt, pathological hypogonadism. In addition, the increasing number of comorbidities, together with the high prevalence of chronic diseases, all further contribute to the decrease of serum T concentrations in the aging male. For all these reasons both the diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) in men and the decision about starting or not T replacement treatment remain challenging. At present, the biochemical finding of T deficiency alone is not sufficient for diagnosing hypogonadism in older men. Coupling hypogonadal symptoms with documented low serum T represents the best strategy to refine the diagnosis of hypogonadism in older men and to avoid unnecessary treatments.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Absolute lymphocytopenia has been reported as a predictor of bacteremia in medical emergencies. Likewise, the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) has been shown a simple promising method to evaluate systemic inflammation in critically ill patients. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the ability of conventional infection markers, lymphocyte count and NLCR to predict bacteremia in adult patients admitted to the Emergency Department with suspected communityacquired bacteremia. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and NLCR were compared between patients with positive blood cultures (n = 92) and agematched and gender-matched patients with negative blood cultures (n = 92) obtained upon Emergency Department admission. Results: Significant differences between patients with positive and negative blood cultures were detected with respect to the CRP level (mean {\textpm} standard deviation 176 {\textpm} 138 mg/l vs. 116 {\textpm} 103 mg/l; P = 0.042), lymphocyte count (0.8 {\textpm} 0.5 {\texttimes} 109/l vs. 1.2 {\textpm} 0.7 {\texttimes} 109/l; P {$<$} 0.0001) and NLCR (20.9 {\textpm} 13.3 vs. 13.2 {\textpm} 14.1; P {$<$} 0.0001) but not regarding WBC count and neutrophil count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were highest for the NLCR (77.2\%, 63.0\%, 67.6\% and 73.4\%, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for the lymphocyte count (0.73; confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.80) and the NLCR (0.73; 0.66 to 0.81). Conclusions: In an emergency care setting, both lymphocytopenia and NLCR are better predictors of bacteremia than routine parameters like CRP level, WBC count and neutrophil count. Attention to these markers is easy to integrate in daily practice and without extra costs.},

Women undergo sweeping endocrinological changes at least twice during their lifetime, puberty and menopause, with many women undergoing an additional transition: pregnancy, which may or may not be accompanied by breastfeeding. These endocrinological transitions exert significant effects on the immune system due to interactions between the hormonal milieu, innate, and adaptive immune systems as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and thereby modulate the susceptibility of women to autoimmune diseases. Conversely, pre-existing autoimmune diseases themselves impact endocrine transitions. Concentration-dependent effects of estrogen on the immune system; the role of progesterone, androgens, leptin, oxytocin, and prolactin; and the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses together maintain a delicate balance between host defense, immunological tolerance and autoimmunity. In this review, multiple autoimmune diseases have been analyzed in the context of each of the three endocrinological transitions in women. We provide evidence from human epidemiological data and animal studies that endocrine transitions exert profound impact on the development of autoimmune diseases in women through complex mechanisms. Greater understanding of endocrine transitions and their role in autoimmune diseases could aid in prediction, prevention, and cures of these debilitating diseases in women.},

However, data on the effects of androgens on mammary epithelial proliferation and/or breast cancer incidence are not in full agreement. We performed a literature review evaluating current clinical, genetic and epidemiological data regarding the role of androgens in mammary growth and neoplasia. Epidemiological studies appear to have significant methodological limitations and thus provide inconclusive results. The study of molecular defects involving androgenic pathways in breast cancer is still in its infancy. Clinical and nonhuman primate studies suggest that androgens inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth while conventional estrogen treatment suppresses endogenous androgens. Abundant clinical evidence suggests that androgens normally inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth. Suppression of androgens using conventional estrogen treatment may thus enhance estrogenic breast stimulation and possibly breast cancer risk. Addition of testosterone to the usual hormone therapy regimen may diminish the estrogen/progestin increase in breast cancer risk but the impact of this combined use on mammary gland homeostasis still needs evaluation.},

  abstract = {Autoimmune diseases are characterized by a significant sex dimorphism, with women showing increased susceptibility to disease. This is, at least in part, due to sex-dependent differences in the immune system that are influenced by the complex interplay between sex hormones and sex chromosomes, with contribution from sociological factors, diet and gut microbiota. Sex differences are evident in the number and function of lymphocyte populations. Women mount a stronger pro-inflammatory response than males, with increased lymphocyte proliferation, activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, whereas men display expanded regulatory cell subsets. Ageing alters the immune landscape of men and women in differing ways, resulting in changes in autoimmune disease susceptibility. Here we review the current literature on sex differences in lymphocyte function, the factors that influence this, and the implications for autoimmune disease. We propose that improved understanding of sex bias in lymphocyte function can provide sex-specific tailoring of treatment strategies for better management of autoimmune diseases.},

Our analysis of 15 developed countries shows that, as infant mortality declined over two centuries, the excess male mortality increased from 10\% in 1751 to {$>$}30\% by approximately 1970. Remarkably, since 1970, the male disadvantage in most countries fell back to lower levels. The worsening male disadvantage from 1751 until 1970 may be due to differential changes in cause-specific infant mortality by sex. Declines in infant mortality from infections and the shift of deaths to perinatal conditions favored females. The reduction in male excess infant mortality after 1970 can be attributed to improved obstetric practices and neonatal care. The additional male infants who survived because of better conditions were more likely to be premature or have low birth weight, which could have implications for their health in later life. This analysis provides evidence of marked changes in the sex ratio of mortality at an age when behavioral differences should be minimal. {\copyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

METHODS: We assessed age at menarche by questionnaire among 204 healthy Norwegian women, aged 25-35 years. Measures of body composition included body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), waist circumference (WC, cm), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and fat percentage dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, (DEXA). Daily salivary 17-beta-estradiol (E(2)) concentrations were collected throughout one entire menstrual cycle and assessed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Linear regression analyses and linear mixed models for repeated measures were used and potential confounding factors and effect modifiers were tested. RESULTS: Among women with an early age at menarche ({$<$} or =12 years), the overall mean salivary E(2) concentration increased by 3.7 pmol/l (95\% confidence interval, 1.8-5.7 pmol/l) with each 9.8 cm (1 SD) increase in WC, which represents a 20.7\% change in the mean for the total group. Among the same early maturers, a 1 SD (0.06) change in WHR was directly associated with a 24.0\% change in mean E(2) concentration for the total group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that early age at menarche, together with adult overweight and obesity, result in high levels of 17-beta-estradiol throughout the menstrual cycle.},

Importantly, these sex-based differences in humoral immunity contribute to variation in the responses to vaccines and may explain some disparities in vaccine efficacy between the sexes. Elevated humoral immunity in females compared with males is phylogenetically well conserved, suggesting an adaptive advantage of elevated antibody for reproductive success, including for the transfer of protective antibodies to offspring.},

  abstract = {Objective: Accurate measurements of prevalence of ``any'' breastfeeding and ``exclusive'' breastfeeding help assess progress toward public health goals. We compared two commonly used data sources for measuring breastfeeding rates to assess agreement. Methods: The National Immunization Survey (NIS) is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to measure progress toward national breastfeeding goals and obtains breastfeeding outcomes retrospectively at 19--35 months. The California Newborn Screen (CNS) is a contemporaneous measure of breastfeeding during birth hospitalization and measures progress toward public health goals in California. We compared results for ``any breastfeeding'' and ``exclusive breastfeeding'' for California infants in the NIS to those in the CNS using descriptive statistics. Results: Our results show that the two methods produce similar results for ``any'' breastfeeding at {$<$}4 days: 82.7\%, 95\% confidence interval (79.6\%, 85.8\%) in the NIS and 86.1\% (86.0\%, 86.2\%) in the CNS. However, the two methods produce very different results for ``exclusive'' breastfeeding at {$<$}4 days: 60.4\% (56.6\%, 64.1\%) in the NIS and 41.6\% (41.5\%, 41.7\%) in the CNS. Rates of ``exclusive'' breastfeeding varied more for some subgroups; for Hispanics, estimates were 61.1\% (56.1\%, 66.1\%) in the NIS and 29.7\% (29.5\%, 29.9\%) in the CNS. Conclusions: There is good agreement between two disparate methods for assessing ``any'' breastfeeding rates. However, our findings suggest that the NIS, the CNS, or both are flawed measures of ``exclusive'' breastfeeding. Validated methods for measuring ``exclusive'' breastfeeding would allow improved monitoring of breastfeeding prevalence.},

Many studies, both experimental and correlational, have been conducted to test the relationship between immune function and the sex hormones testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. However, the results are mixed. We conducted four cross-species meta-analyses to investigate the relationship between sex hormones and immune function: (i) the effect of testosterone manipulation on immune function in males, (ii) the correlation between circulating testosterone level and immune function in males, (iii) the effect of oestrogen manipulation on immune function in females, and (iv) the correlation between circulating oestrogen level and immune function in females. The results from the experimental studies showed that testosterone had a medium-sized immunosuppressive effect on immune function. The effect of oestrogen, on the other hand, depended on the immune measure used. Oestrogen suppressed cell-mediated immune function while reducing parasite loads. The overall correlation (meta-analytic relationship) between circulating sex hormone level and immune function was not statistically significant for either testosterone or oestrogen despite the power of meta-analysis. These results suggest that correlational studies have limited value for testing the effects of sex hormones on immune function. We found little evidence of publication bias in the four data sets using indirect tests. There was a weak and positive relationship between year of publication and effect size for experimental studies of testosterone that became non-significant after we controlled for castration and immune measure, suggesting that the temporal trend was due to changes in these moderators over time. Graphical analyses suggest that the temporal trend was due to an increased use of cytokine measures across time. We found substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes, except in correlational studies of testosterone, even after we accounted for the relevant random and fixed factors. In conclusion, our results provide good evidence that testosterone suppresses immune function and that the effect of oestrogen varies depending on the immune measure used.},

  abstract = {Significance             There are marked differences between the sexes in their immune response to infections and vaccination, with females often having significantly higher responses. However, the mechanisms underlying these differences are largely not understood. Using a systems immunology approach, we have identified a cluster of genes involved in lipid metabolism and likely modulated by testosterone that correlates with the higher antibody-neutralizing response to influenza vaccination observed in females. Moreover, males with the highest testosterone levels and expression of related gene signatures exhibited the lowest antibody responses to influenza vaccination. This study generates a number of hypotheses on the sex differences observed in the human immune system and their relationship to mechanisms involved in the antibody response to vaccination.           ,              Females have generally more robust immune responses than males for reasons that are not well-understood. Here we used a systems analysis to investigate these differences by analyzing the neutralizing antibody response to a trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) and a large number of immune system components, including serum cytokines and chemokines, blood cell subset frequencies, genome-wide gene expression, and cellular responses to diverse in vitro stimuli, in 53 females and 34 males of different ages. We found elevated antibody responses to TIV and expression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum of females compared with males regardless of age. This inflammatory profile correlated with the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 proteins in monocytes but not with the serological response to the vaccine. In contrast, using a machine learning approach, we identified a cluster of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and previously shown to be up-regulated by testosterone that correlated with poor virus-neutralizing activity in men. Moreover, men with elevated serum testosterone levels and associated gene signatures exhibited the lowest antibody responses to TIV. These results demonstrate a strong association between androgens and genes involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting that these could be important drivers of the differences in immune responses between males and females.},

  abstract = {1.The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) proposes that androgen-dependent sexual traits are honest indicators of male quality because androgens are thought to suppress the immune system's ability to combat parasitic infection. Yet, recent work suggests that the relationship between androgens and parasitism is more complex, as androgens may have different effects on the various types of parasites. 2.We explored this issue in free-living mountain spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, by measuring the prevalence of four endoparasite species and one ectoparasite species in castrated, sham-operated and testosterone (T)-implanted males. 3.We found that effects of T manipulation accounted for the greatest amount of variability in the abundance of Trombiculid mites and two gastrointestinal nematodes (Physaloptera retusa and Spauligodon giganticus). Plasma T levels were positively associated with mite loads, negatively associated with P. retusa loads and not associated with S. giganticus load. We also found that T treatment had little effect on the abundances of two species of blood-borne endoparasites (Plasmodium chiricahuae and an unidentified haemogregarine). Instead, the prevalence of these two parasites was mostly influenced by other physiological or seasonal factors, such as corticosterone levels, body condition, fat stores or time between capture events. 4.Our data illustrate that T can have functionally distinct and opposing effects on different parasite species. This finding supports the hypothesis that T does not depress the immune system in a way that causes an across-the-board increase in parasitism. 5.We speculate that T modifies select behavioural and physiological factors that govern parasite accumulation. Evolutionarily, our data also imply that the net 'cost of T' with respect to elevated ectoparasitism may be at least partially offset by concomitant reductions in helminth load. {\copyright} 2010 The Authors.

  abstract = {Abstract ---Recent studies have postulated the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) released by the endothelium to the beneficial effects of estrogen. Despite a neuronal-type NO synthase (nNOS) described in neutrophils, less is known about the effect of estrogen in these cells. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of nNOS protein in human neutrophils under different estrogenic conditions. We first analyzed nNOS expression in neutrophils obtained from premenopausal women. During the first 2 days of the follicular phase (low circulating estrogen concentrations), nNOS expression in neutrophils was reduced with respect to that found in neutrophils obtained from the same donors during the ovulatory phase (high circulating estrogen concentrations). Moreover, the expression of nNOS protein in neutrophils obtained from postmenopausal women after transdermal estrogen therapy was markedly enhanced with respect to that observed before the treatment. In vitro incubation of neutrophils derived from men for 6 hours with 17{$\beta$}-estradiol (10 -10 to 10 -8 mol/L) upregulated the expression of nNOS protein. The 17{$\beta$}-estradiol receptor antagonists, tamoxifen (10 -8 mol/L) and ICI 182780 (10 -8 mol/L), inhibited the upregulation of nNOS protein induced by 17{$\beta$}-estradiol. The putative functional implication was denoted by a reduced expression of the CD18 antigen on the surface of 17{$\beta$}-estradiol--incubated neutrophils, which was accompanied by a decreased adhesive capacity. Both effects were prevented by an NO antagonist. In conclusion, the in vivo levels of circulating estrogen concentrations seem to be associated with the level of nNOS protein expression in neutrophils from women. Moreover, low doses of 17{$\beta$}-estradiol upregulate nNOS protein expression in neutrophils from men. The increased ability of 17{$\beta$}-estradiol--incubated neutrophils derived from men to produce NO reduced their adhesive properties.},

  abstract = {X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is thought to catalyze silencing of X-linked genes in cis during X-chromosome inactivation, which equalizes X-linked gene dosage between male and female mammals. To test the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, we ectopically induced endogenous Xist by ablating the antisense repressor Tsix in mice. We find that ectopic Xist RNA induction and subsequent X-linked gene silencing is sex specific in embryos and in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). A higher frequency of X {$\Delta$}Tsix Y male cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with X {$\Delta$}Tsix X female cells. This increase reflected the inability of X {$\Delta$}Tsix Y cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes compared with X {$\Delta$}Tsix X cells, despite equivalent Xist RNA induction and coating. Silencing of genes on both Xs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in X {$\Delta$}Tsix X female cells relative to X {$\Delta$}Tsix Y male cells. Thus, whereas Xist RNA can inactivate the X chromosome in females it may not do so in males. We further found comparable silencing in differentiating X {$\Delta$}Tsix Y and 39, X {$\Delta$}Tsix ( X {$\Delta$}Tsix O ) ESCs, excluding the Y chromosome and instead implicating the X-chromosome dose as the source of the sex-specific differences. Because X {$\Delta$}Tsix X female embryonic epiblast cells and EpiSCs harbor an inactivated X chromosome prior to ectopic inactivation of the active X {$\Delta$}Tsix X chromosome, we propose that the increased expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees activates Xist and, separately, helps trigger X-linked gene silencing.},

T helper (Th) cells play a central role in modulating immune responses and recent advances have defined distinct contributions of various Th cell subsets throughout each phase of human pregnancy, while dysregulation in Th responses show association with multiple obstetrical complications. In addition to localized decidual mechanisms, modulation of Th cell immunity during gestation is mediated largely by oscillations in sex hormone concentrations. Aberrant Th cell responses also underlie several autoimmune disorders while pregnancy-induced changes in the balance of Th cell immunity has been shown to exert favorable outcomes in the progression Th1 and Th17 driven autoimmune conditions only to be followed by post-partal exacerbations in disease.},

We previously reported that neutrophils from reproductive-age males are more immature and less activated than their female counterparts. To further characterize the mechanisms that drive differential neutrophil phenotypes, we performed RNA sequencing on circulating neutrophils from healthy adult females and males. Female neutrophils displayed significant up-regulation of type I IFN (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that these differences are neutrophil specific, driven by a distinct neutrophil subset and related to maturation status. Neutrophil hyperresponsiveness to type I IFNs promoted enhanced responses to Toll-like receptor agonists. Neutrophils from young adult males had significantly increased mitochondrial metabolism compared to those from females and this was modulated by estradiol. Assessment of ISGs and neutrophil maturation genes in Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) males and in prepubescent children supported that differences in neutrophil phenotype between adult male and female neutrophils are hormonally driven and not explained by X chromosome gene dosage. Our results indicate that there are distinct sex differences in neutrophil biology related to responses to type I IFNs, immunometabolism, and maturation status that may have prominent functional and pathogenic implications.},

We hypothesize that global historical increases in life span at older ages are partly explained by reduced lifetime exposure to infection and subsequent inflammation. To begin a test of this hypothesis, we compare C-reactive protein (CRP); levels in two populations with different epidemiological environments: the Tsimane of Bolivia and persons in the United States. High CRP is significantly more prevalent among the Tsimane up through middle age; by age 35, the Tsimane have spent more years with high CRP than have Americans at age 55. Further testing of the links among infection, inflammation, and chronic diseases of aging among the Tsimane requires collection of age-specific indicators of atherosclerosis and cardiac function.},

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 298 pediatric patients (age{$\leq$}36 months) with febrile UTI from January 2010 to December 2014. Conventional infection markers (white blood cell [WBC] count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]), and NLR were measured. Results: WBC, CRP, ESR, and NLR were higher in APN than in lower UTI (P{$<$}0.001). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that NLR was a predictive factor for positive dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defects (P{$<$}0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was high for NLR (P{$<$}0.001) as well as CRP (P{$<$}0.001) for prediction of DMSA defects. NLR showed the highest area under the ROC curve for diagnosis of VUR (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusion: NLR can be used as a diagnostic marker of APN with DMSA defect, showing better results than those of conventional markers for VUR prediction.},

  abstract = {Background: Age-specific trends of serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin across the full lifespan have not been reported. Methods: We deduced age-specific trends in serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin in males and females between ages 10 and 90 from a large sample of consecutive results from a single large pathology laboratory. Coded results of 110,712 consecutive blood samples requesting serum testosterone over seven years (2007--2013) comprising blood testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin and calculated free testosterone together with gender and age were analysed create smoothed age-specific centiles (2.5\%, 5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 95\%, 97.5\%) for males and females. Results: These identified the pubertal increases in serum testosterone in males peaking at 20 years of age and remaining stable thereafter until the eighth decade. In females, circulating testosterone peaked in late adolescence and declined gradually over the next two decades but remained stable across menopause and beyond. After early childhood, serum sex hormone-binding globulin declines to a nadir in males at the age of 20 years and remains stable till the sixth decade with a gradual, progressive rise thereafter. In females, the sex hormone-binding globulin nadir is reached earlier with levels rising gradually and progressively with age thereafter and accelerating after the age of 70 years. Females also exhibit a second sex hormone-binding globulin peak during reproductive ages reflected only in upper centiles due to effects of pregnancy and oral contraceptive use in a significant minority of females. Conclusions: This large sample of clinical data provides a comprehensive profile of androgen status across the lifespan from early adolescence to late old age.},

  abstract = {Methods: We measured complete blood cell counts at admission and on postoperative day 1 for 458 women who had cesareans. Information from charts was abstracted, and definitions of infectious outcomes and fever were applied by three physicians masked to laboratory results. We examined changes in absolute and relative WBC counts by labor status. Likelihood ratios for postoperative infection were calculated for statistically distinct categories of percentage changes. Results: We excluded 60 women with chorioamnionitis. Of the remainder, 34 (8.5\%) developed endometritis and three (0.8\%) pneumonia. Women who labored before cesarean (n ؍ 198) had higher antepartum (P {$<$} .001) and postoperative day 1 (P {$<$} .001) WBC counts than those who did not (n ؍ 200). However, change in WBC count after cesarean relative to antepartum was similar for both groups (P ؍ .41), averaging a 22\% increase. We grouped percentage changes into the following three levels: up to 24\%, 25--99\%, and at least 100\%. The lowest level (n ؍ 246) corresponded to a categoryspecific likelihood ratio for diagnosis of serious postpartum infection of 0.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.3, 0.8), the midlevel (n ؍ 141) to a category-specific likelihood ratio of 1.7 (95\% CI 1.2, 2.3), and the highest level (n ؍ 11) to a category-specific likelihood ratio of 5.8 (95\% CI 1.8, 18.7). Conclusion: Labor influenced postcesarean WBC counts but did not obscure changes associated with infection. Information gained from changes in WBC counts can be used to assess risk of infection.

Methods: Patients were included from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Biobank. Information on patient NLR was obtained just before their first treatment and clinical information was provided by the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Register. Information on NLR from controls was collected from the Danish Blood Donor Study. Patients and controls were 1:2 propensity score matched by baseline confounders. Results: Propensity score matching left 740 of 743 MS patients and 1420 of 4691 controls for further analyses. Odds-ratio (OR) was 3.64 (95\% confidence interval 2.87--4.60, p {$<$} 0.001) for MS disease per unit increase of logarithmically transformed NLR (ln-NLR), corresponding to an OR of 2.68 for each doubling of NLR.

Chronic immune stimulation characterizes many autoimmune disorders. We hypothesized that repeated stimulation may cause a different T-cell response in women than in men. Microarrays were used to compare gene expression in T cells from healthy men and women with and without repeated stimulation. Four days after a single stimulation, only 25\% of differentially expressed, gender-biased genes were expressed at higher levels in women. In contrast, after restimulation, 72\% were more highly expressed in women. Immune response genes were significantly over-represented among the genes upregulated in women and among the immune response genes, the inflammatory/cytotoxic effector genes interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}), lymphotoxin {$\beta$} (LT{$\beta$}), granzyme A (GZMA), interleukin-12 receptor {$\beta$}2 (IL12R{$\beta$}2), and granulysin (GNLY) were among those overexpressed to the highest degree. In contrast, IL17A was the only effector gene more highly expressed in men. Estrogen response elements were identified in the promoters of half the overexpressed immune genes in women, and in {$<$}10\% of the male-biased genes. The differential expression of inflammatory/cytotoxic effector molecules in restimulated female T cells may contribute to the differences in autoimmune diseases between women and men.},

Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

Children born to obese mothers are at increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease and are susceptible to develop neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders. Changes in placental function not only play a critical role in the development of pregnancy complications but may also be involved in linking maternal obesity to long-term health risks in the infant. Maternal adipokines i.e., interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}), leptin and adiponectin link maternal nutritional status and adipose tissue metabolism to placental function. Adipokines and metabolic hormones have direct impact on placental function by modulating placental nutrient transport. Nutrient delivery to the fetus is regulated by a complex interaction between insulin signaling, cytokine profile and insulin responsiveness, which is modulated by adiponectin and IL-1{$\beta$}. In addition, obese pregnant women are at risk for hypertension and preeclampsia with reduced placental vascularity and blood flow, which would restrict placental nutrient delivery to the developing fetus. These sometimes opposing signals regulating placental function may contribute to the diversity of short and long-term outcomes observed in pregnant obese women. This review focuses on the changes in adipokines and obesity-related metabolic hormones, how these factors influence placental function and fetal development to contribute to long-term metabolic and behavioral consequences of children born to obese mothers.},

  abstract = {Significance             Differences in immune functioning stem from multiple factors, including sex and aging. However, the specific roles of these variables in immunity remain elusive. We profiled immunocytes from young and old males and females at single-cell resolution and constructed a precise atlas of blood-circulating immunocytes. T cell-- and B cell--activated signals were higher in young females than males, while aging increased the sex-related differences in immunocytes, cellular composition, and inflammatory signaling. Additionally, males showed a higher accumulation of inflammatory factors during aging, whereas cell--cell communication analysis revealed different trends in gene expression between females and males with aging. These findings might aid in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying sex-based differences in immunity and disease susceptibility across the lifespan.           ,              Sex and aging influence the human immune system, resulting in disparate responses to infection, autoimmunity, and cancer. However, the impact of sex and aging on the immune system is not yet fully elucidated. Using small conditional RNA sequencing, we found that females had a lower percentage of natural killer (NK) cells and a higher percentage of plasma cells in peripheral blood compared with males. Bioinformatics revealed that young females exhibited an overrepresentation of pathways that relate to T and B cell activation. Moreover, cell--cell communication analysis revealed evidence of increased activity of the BAFF/APRIL systems in females. Notably, aging increased the percentage of monocytes and reduced the percentage of na{\"i}ve T cells in the blood and the number of differentially expressed genes between the sexes. Aged males expressed higher levels of inflammatory genes. Collectively, the results suggest that females have more plasma cells in the circulation and a stronger BAFF/APRIL system, which is consistent with a stronger adaptive immune response. In contrast, males have a higher percentage of NK cells in blood and a higher expression of certain proinflammatory genes. Overall, this work expands our knowledge of sex differences in the immune system in humans.},

The activity and protein expression of the amino acid transporter systems A and L were measured in syncytiotrophoblast microvillous plasma membranes. Results: Birth weights (range, 3025-- 4235 g) were positively correlated to maternal body mass index (P Ͻ 0.05). The activity of placental insulin/IGF-I and mTOR signaling was positively correlated (P Ͻ 0.001), whereas AMPK phosphorylation was inversely (P Ͻ 0.05) correlated to birth weight. Microvillous plasma membrane system A, but not system L, activity and protein expression of the system A isoform SNAT2 were positively correlated to birth weight (P Ͻ 0.001). Conclusions: Up-regulation of specific placental amino acid transporter isoforms may contribute to fetal overgrowth in maternal obesity. This effect may be mediated by activation of insulin/IGF-I and mTOR signaling pathways, which are positive regulators of placental amino acid transporters.

  abstract = {The suppression of reproductive function is known to occur in women engaging in activities that require high energetic expenses, such as sport participation and subsistence work. It is still unclear, however, if reproductive suppression is a response to high levels of energy expenditure, or only to the resulting state of negative energy balance. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that work-related energy expenditure alone, without associated negative energy balance, can lead to the suppression of reproductive function in women. We document suppression of ovarian function expressed as lowered salivary progesterone levels in women from an agricultural community who work hard, but remain in neutral energy balance. We propose two alternative evolutionary explanations (the 'pre-emptive ovarian suppression' hypothesis and the 'constrained down-regulation' hypothesis) for the observed results},

  abstract = {Female mammals can optimize their fitness by temporal suppression of reproductive function in response to unfavorable environmental conditions. Since reproduction is energetically demanding for a human female, ovarian function is expected to be sensitive to factors influencing energy availability and metabolism. Dieting and exercise in women from industrial countries, and low-calorie diet and workload in women from developing countries, are often associated with ovarian suppression. This study shows that in Polish rural women seasonal changes in workload correlate with seasonal changes in indices of ovarian function (progesterone measured in saliva samples collected daily for six menstrual cycles for each subject). Mean levels of energy expenditure of the most work demanding weeks of the summer exceeded mean levels of energy expenditure during winter by 37\%. Energy intake in this population was sufficient throughout the year. During the summer, when physical work was most intense, low values of progesterone levels were observed (178.2 pmol/L in July and 182.2 pmol/L in August), indicating ovarian suppression. Mean progesterone levels rose to 234.6 pmol/L in October when levels of energy expenditure were lower due to cessation of harvest-related activities. As indicated by several causal models tested through path analysis, energy expenditure was the only variable responsible for suppressed progesterone levels during the summer. Variables describing the nutritional status and energy balance did not correlate significantly with progesterone levels; neither body weight nor body fat or seasonal changes of these variables seem to influence ovarian function in this population. Thus work-related energy expenditure does not need to lead to negative energy balance in order to cause suppression of reproductive function in women.},

Specific lymphocyte subset reference intervals should be locally established for meaningful comparison and to obtain an accurate interpretation of the results. Reference intervals of lymphocyte subsets for Chinese children are scarce. We performed dual-platform flow cytometry to determine the reference intervals of the percentages and absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets, including total T-cells, TH cells, TC cells, B-cells, and NK-cells in 1,027 ethnic Han children aged 4 months to 7 years in Henan, China. The children were divided into seven age groups. The percentages and absolute counts differed significantly with age, with the percentages of TH cells and B cells and the CD4/CD8 ratio peaking during the first year, while the percentages of total T cells, TC cells, and NK cells were obviously increased with age; girls showed a trend toward having a higher percentage of TH cells and a higher CD4/CD8 ratio than boys. The absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets peaked during first year and then decreased steadily with age. The reference intervals of lymphocyte subsets among children from China differed from the reported values in Hong Kong, the United States, Cameroon, and Italy. The differences observed could be due to genetic and environmental factors, coupled with the methodology used. The reference intervals of lymphocyte subsets could be used as initial national reference ranges in guidelines for children aged 4 months to 7 years. {\copyright} 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A tertiary center for pediatric endocrinology at the University Hospital of Copenhagen. Patients or Other Participants: Healthy infants (1840) and patients with DSD (27), aged 2 to 5 months. Main Outcome Measures: Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone (T), estradiol, sex hormone--binding globulin (SHBG), inhibin B, anti-Mu{\textasciidieresis} llerian hormone (AMH), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione, and LH/FSH ratio. Results: LH and FSH concentrations showed overlap between sexes, with LH being highest in boys and FSH being highest in girls. The LH/FSH ratio separated infant boys from girls with minimal overlap at a cutoff value of 0.32. Inhibin B and AMH concentrations were markedly higher in boys compared with girls, with minimal or no overlap. In infants with Klinefelter syndrome, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism and male phenotype, and Turner syndrome, the LH/FSH ratio matched the gender of rearing. However, infants with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome had LH/FSH ratios within the male range. Conclusions: Reference ranges for reproductive hormones and LH/FSH ratio during mini-puberty were established in this study. The classifiers that best separated sex in mini-puberty were AMH, LH/FSH ratio, and T. Use of the LH/FSH ratio may add valuable information in the workup of infants suspected of DSD.

Objective{\enspace}               Teenagers are susceptible to delivering small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. Previous studies suggest that maternal growth may contribute, as a result of preferential nutrient partitioning to the mother. We investigated the impact of maternal growth on birthweight in pregnant teenagers in the UK, and examined endocrine mediators of nutrient partitioning.                                         Design{\enspace}               A prospective observational multicentre study, About Teenage Eating, conducted between 2004 and 2007.

Population{\enspace}               A total of 500 pregnant adolescents (14--18{$\quad$}years of age) with a singleton pregnancy were recruited at 10--21{$\quad$}weeks of gestation, with follow-up studies on 368 subjects. A cohort of 80 pregnant adults (25--40{$\quad$}years of age) provided a control group for determining growth.                                         Methods{\enspace}               Skeletal growth, weight gain and skinfold thickness were measured from first to third trimester, together with maternal levels of micronutrients and metabolic hormones: insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and leptin. Dietary analyses were performed.                                         Main outcome measure{\enspace}               SGA birth.                                         Results{\enspace}               Maternal growth was not associated with SGA birth: growing mothers delivered more large-for-gestational-age infants (OR 2.51;               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.05). Growers had greater weight gain (               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.001), fat accrual (               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.001) and red cell folate concentrations (               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.01) than non-growers. Maternal IGF-I (               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.01) and leptin (               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.001) were positively associated with maternal and fetal growth, whereas IGF-I (               P{$\quad$}               {$<\quad$}0.001) was negatively associated. Teenagers that were underweight at booking or with low weight gain were at greater risk of SGA birth.                                         Conclusions{\enspace}               Maternal growth was not detrimental to fetal growth in this UK population of teenagers. Greater weight gain and higher concentrations of IGF-I in growing teenagers may provide anabolic drive for maternal and fetal growth.},

The aim of this study is to compare the NLR values of mild and severe preeclampsia with the normotensive pregnant women, in order to explore the predictive role of NLR for preeclampsia and whether the NLR value has significant difference between severe and mild preeclampsia. Design and methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane database for relative literature up to May 2019. The statistical analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software. Results: Totally 15 eligible studies consisting of 3982 patients were enrolled in our meta-analysis. The NLR value is higher in preeclampsia when compared to healthy pregnant women (3270 women, MD: 1.44, 95\% CI [1.04, 1.83]). Furthermore, NLR value is higher in severe preeclampsia than in mild preeclampsia (1287 women, MD: 1.12, 95\% CI [0.69,1.56]). Conclusions: The findings of our meta-analysis suggest that NLR value is higher in preeclampsia patients especially in severe preeclampsia. The NLR might be a useful laboratory marker for clinical prediction and disease severity evaluation of preeclampsia. However, given that the available evidence is mainly drawn from case-control studies, future cohorts are needed in this field to accurately determine optimal timing and cut-off values that may be used in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {The Human Sciences address problems in nature and society that often require coordinated approaches of several scientific disciplines and scholarly research, embracing the social and biological sciences, and history. When we wish, for example, to understand how some sub-populations and not others come to be vulnerable, why a disease spreads in one part of a population and not another, or which gene variants are transmitted across generations, then a remarkable range of disciplinary perspectives need to be brought together, from the study of institutional structures, cultural boundaries, and social networks down to the micro-biology of cellular pathways, and gene expression. The need to explain and address differential impacts of pressing contemporary issues like AIDS, ageing, social and economic inequalities, and environmental change, are well-known cases in point. Population concepts, models, and evidence lie at the core of approaches to all of these problems, if only because accurate differentiation and identification of groups, their structures, constituents, and relations between sub-populations, are necessary to specify their nature and extent. The study of population thus draws both on statistical methodologies of demography and population genetics and sustained observation of the ways in which populations and sub-populations are formed, maintained, or broken up in nature, in the laboratory, and in society. In an era in which research needs to operate on multiple levels, population thinking thus provides a common ground for communication and critical thought across disciplines.  Population in the Human Sciences addresses the need for review and assessment of the framework of interdisciplinary population studies. Limitations to prevailing postwar paradigms like the Evolutionary Synthesis and Demographic Transition were becoming evident by the 1970s. Subsequent decades have witnessed an immense expansion of population modelling and related empirical inquiry, with new genetic developments that have reshaped evolutionary, population, and developmental biology. The rise of anthropological and historical demography, and social network analysis, are playing major roles in rethinking modern and earlier population history. More recently, the emergence of sub-disciplines like biodemography and evolutionary anthropology, and growing links between evolutionary and developmental biology, indicate a growing convergence of biological and social approaches to population.},

  abstract = {Background Conventional coronary artery disease risk factors might potentially explain at least 90\% of the attributable risk of coronary artery disease. To better understand the association between the pre-industrial lifestyle and low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors, we examined the Tsimane, a Bolivian population living a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, gathering, fishing, and farming with few cardiovascular risk factors, but high infectious inflammatory burden. Methods We did a cross-sectional cohort study including all individuals who self-identified as Tsimane and who were aged 40 years or older. Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring done with non-contrast CT in Tsimane adults. We assessed the difference between the Tsimane and 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC scores higher than 100 were considered representative of significant atherosclerotic disease. Tsimane blood lipid and inflammatory biomarkers were obtained at the time of scanning, and in some patients, longitudinally. Findings Between July 2, 2014, and Sept 10, 2015, 705 individuals, who had data available for analysis, were included in this study. 596 (85\%) of 705 Tsimane had no CAC, 89 (13\%) had CAC scores of 1--100, and 20 (3\%) had CAC scores higher than 100. For individuals older than age 75 years, 31 (65\%) Tsimane presented with a CAC score of 0, and only four (8\%) had CAC scores of 100 or more, a five-fold lower prevalence than industrialised populations (p{$\leq$}0{$\cdot$}0001 for all age categories of MESA). Mean LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were 2{$\cdot$}35 mmol/L (91 mg/dL) and 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (39{$\cdot$}5 mg/dL), respectively; obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar, and regular cigarette smoking were rare. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was elevated beyond the clinical cutoff of 3{$\cdot$}0 mg/dL in 360 (51\%) Tsimane participants. Interpretation Despite a high infectious inflammatory burden, the Tsimane, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors, have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date. These findings suggest that coronary atherosclerosis can be avoided in most people by achieving a lifetime with very low LDL, low blood pressure, low glucose, normal body-mass index, no smoking, and plenty of physical activity. The relative contributions of each are still to be determined. Funding National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health; St Luke's Hospital of Kansas City; and Paleocardiology Foundation.},

It has been suggested that minipuberty contributes to the development of reproductive organs, somatic growth, cognitive/behavioural and sex-specific brain development. Given the well-known trade-off between the reproductive/endocrine and immune systems in adults, the immunological approach to minipuberty, which is characterized by transient activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis, seems to be ignored.

Materials and Methods               A total of 121 newborns (58 male) were included in this cross-sectional study. The hormone and lymphocyte subsets studied were as follow: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) estradiol (E), testosterone (T), CD19, CD16/56, CD3, CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8 and HLA-DR as lymphocyte activation marker.                                         Results                                The mean FSH levels were higher in females (15.15~{\textpm}~10.12~mIU/ml vs, 2.61~{\textpm}~1.74~mIU/ml) and LH in males (5.80~{\textpm}~2.51~mIU/ml vs. 1.91~{\textpm}~12.89~mIU/ml) (                 P                 ~{$<~$}.001 for each). The mean percentages of the CD3/CD4 levels were higher in females (54.61~{\textpm}~6.70\% vs. 51.17~{\textpm}~6.77\%) and CD3/CD8 in males (21.49~{\textpm}~4.82\% vs. 17.31~{\textpm}~3.66\%) (                 P                 ~{$<~$}.001 for each). In the females, the mean FSH levels negatively correlated with CD3/CD4 (r                 FSH-CD3/CD4                 ~=~-0.423,                 P                 ~=~.001) and positively correlated with CD3/CD8 (r                 FSH-CD3/CD8                 ~=~0.311,                 P                 ~=~.013). In the males, LH positively correlated with CD3/CD4 (r                 LH-CD3/CD4                 ~=~0.406,                 P                 ~{$<~$}.001) and negatively correlated with CD3/CD8 (                 rLH-CD3/CD8                 ~=~-0.486,                 P                 ~{$<~$}.001).                                                        Conclusion               This study showed that the mean CD3/CD4 levels were higher in female and CD3/CD8 in male newborns, indicating that there was a sexual dimorphism in favour of immunostimulant in females and immunosuppressor components of immune response in males during the minipuberty. These interactions point to sex-specific trade-off between reproductive/endocrine and immune systems, which it reflects the an investment favouring in the reproductive system against the immune response during minipuberty, which is critical period for adult fertility, especially in males.},

  abstract = {Blood was collected from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) employees to assess variances in leukocyte numbers in January, May, and September throughout a year and over many years. Women and men of ages 20 to 80 volunteered to donate for this program. Most of the blood came from healthy individuals, and many remained healthy throughout the years of their blood donations. The major objective was to determine the extent that blood leukocyte numbers change so that transient vs more lingering changes may be helpful in assessing health status. Since some donors remained in the program for 14 years, age influences over time could be determined. Within a short period of 2--3 years, the flow cytometric immunophenotypic profile of blood lymphocyte is relatively stable with a CV\% of\,{$<$}\,20\%. However, as humans age, the blood \-CD3+ T cell, C\- D8+ T cell, B cell, NKT cell, and \-CD4-/CD8- double-negative T cell (DN-T cell) subsets declined in cell numbers/{$\mu$}L, but the double-positive \-CD4+/CD8+ T cells (DP-T cells) increased in numbers. The extent and chronology of a variance, e.g., a subset exceeding its 75th or 90th percentile, might be indicative of a transient or chronic physiological or psychosocial stress affecting health or a developing pathology; however, because of the wide ranges of cell numbers/{$\mu$}L for each subset among individuals reported as healthy, everyone's immunity and health must be carefully evaluated. A CD4 to CD8 ratio (4/8R) of\,{$<$}\,1 has been used to define an immunodeficiency such as HIV-induced AIDS, but a high 4/8R is less well associated with health status. A high 4/8R or granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio (GLR) might be an indicator of a stress, infection, or immune-related pathology. Sporadic and longitudinal increases of GLRs are reported. The results suggest that there are some age and sex differences in leukocyte numbers; stress influences on the blood profile of leukocytes likely exist. However, some values exceeding 2 standard deviations from means do not necessarily predict a health concern, whereas a longitudinal increase or decline might be indicative of a need for further evaluations.},

  abstract = {Summary             Testosterone is a key hormone in the pathology of metabolic diseases such as obesity. Low testosterone levels are associated with increased fat mass (particularly central adiposity) and reduced lean mass in males. These morphological features are linked to metabolic dysfunction, and testosterone deficiency is associated with energy imbalance, impaired glucose control, reduced insulin sensitivity and dyslipidaemia. A bidirectional relationship between testosterone and obesity underpins this association indicated by the hypogonadal--obesity cycle and evidence weight loss can lead to increased testosterone levels. Androgenic effects on enzymatic pathways of fatty acid metabolism, glucose control and energy utilization are apparent and often tissue specific with differential effects noted in different regional fat depots, muscle and liver to potentially explain the mechanisms of testosterone action. Testosterone replacement therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on measures of obesity that are partially explained by both direct metabolic actions on adipose and muscle and also potentially by increasing motivation, vigour and energy allowing obese individuals to engage in more active lifestyles. The degree of these beneficial effects may be dependent on the treatment modality with longer term administration often achieving greater improvements. Testosterone replacement may therefore potentially be an effective adjunctive treatment for weight management in obese men with concomitant hypogonadism.},

We performed a systematic meta-analysis to investigate the magnitude and direction of sex differences in immunity and to identify factors that shape sex-biased immunocompetence. In addition to considering taxonomic and methodological effects as moderators, we assessed age-related effects, which are predicted to occur if sex differences in immunity are due to sex-specific resource allocation trade-offs with reproduction. In a meta-analysis of 584 effects from 124 studies, we found that females exhibit a significantly stronger immune response than do males, but the effect size is relatively small, and became non-significant after controlling for phylogeny. Female-biased immunity was more pronounced in adult than immature animals. More recently published studies did not report significantly smaller effect sizes. Among taxonomic and methodological subsets of the data, some of the largest effect sizes were in insects, further supporting previous suggestions that testosterone is not the only potential driver of sex differences in immunity. Our findings challenge the notion of pervasive biases towards female-biased immunity and the role of testosterone in driving these differences.},

Design               Retrospective, population based cohort study.                                         Setting               US.                                         Population               40\,529\,905 documented live births between 2007 and 2016.                                         Main outcome measures               Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score at five minutes, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, need for postpartum antibiotics, and seizures. Primary maternal outcomes were gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Secondary outcome was the number of preventable perinatal events.                                         Results               Higher paternal age was associated with an increased risk of premature birth, low birth weight, and low Apgar score. After adjustment for maternal age, infants born to fathers aged 45 years or older had 14\% higher odds of premature birth (odds ratio 1.14, 95\% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.15), independent of gestational age, and 18\% higher odds of seizures (1.18, 0.97 to 1.44) compared with infants of fathers aged 25 to 34 years. The odds of gestational diabetes was 34\% higher (1.34, 1.29 to 1.38) in mothers with the oldest partners. 13.2\% (95\% confidence interval 12.5\% to 13.9\%) of premature births and 18.2\% (17.5\% to 18.9\%) of gestational diabetes in births associated with older fathers were estimated to be attributable to advanced paternal age.                                         Conclusions               Advanced paternal age is associated with negative effects on both mothers and offspring. Given the relatively low prevalence of advanced paternal age in the US, population level impacts are currently modest. Nevertheless, as advanced paternal age has doubled in the US over the past generation, further investigation is warranted of the impact on birth outcomes and public health.},

  abstract = {Autoimmune diseases (AID) predominantly affect women of reproductive age. While basic molecular studies have implicated persisting fetal cells in the mother in some AID, supportive epidemiological evidence is limited. We investigated the effect of vaginal delivery, caesarean section (CS) and induced abortion on the risk of subsequent maternal AID. Using the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) we identified women who were born between 1960 and 1992. We performed data linkage between the CRS other Danish national registers to identify women who had a pregnancy and those who developed AID. Women were categorised into 4 groups; nulligravida (control group), women who had 1st child by vaginal delivery, whose 1st delivery was by CS and who had abortions. Log-linear Poisson regression with person-years was used for data analysis adjusting for several potential confounders. There were 1,035,639 women aged {$>$}14 years and 25,570 developed AID: 43.4\% nulligravida, 44.3\% had their first pregnancy delivered vaginally, 7.6\% CS and 4.1\% abortions. The risk of AID was significantly higher in the 1st year after vaginal delivery (RR = 1.1[1.0, 1.2]) and CS (RR = 1.3[1.1, 1.5]) but significantly lower in the 1st year following abortion (RR = 0.7[0.6, 0.9]). These results suggest an association between pregnancy and the risk of subsequent maternal AID. Increased risks of AID after CS may be explained by amplified fetal cell traffic at delivery, while decreased risks after abortion may be due to the transfer of more primitive fetal stem cells. The increased risk of AID in the first year after delivery may also be related to greater testing during pregnancy.},

Hence, we investigated the clinical significance of these parameters in diagnosing infection in patients with SLE. In total, 120 patients with SLE, who were admitted to hospital due to disease flares or infection, were recruited for the study. Of the 120 patients, 60 had a concurrent infection (SLE with infection), while the remaining 60 patients were admitted with a flare without any evidence of infection (SLE with flare). NLR was higher in the patients with SLE with infection, compared to patients with SLE with flare (14.2~{\textpm}~15.4 versus 3.3~{\textpm}~2.2, p~{$<~$}0.001). Additionally, PLR was higher in the SLE with infection group than in the SLE with flare group (357.7~{\textpm}~350.1 versus 231.7~{\textpm}~152.9, p~=~0.012), but not MLR. In the SLE with infection group, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels positively correlated with NLR and PLR. NLR with a cut-off value of 5.70 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.872 indicated good sensitivity (75\%) and specificity (90\%), for the diagnosis of SLE with infection. CRP with a cut-off value of 1.28~mg/dL (AUC 0.942) showed the sensitivity (93.3\%) and specificity (91.7\%). NLR with a cut-off value of 5.70 and CRP with a cut-off value of 1.28~mg/dL showed the increased specificity (98.3\%) than only CRP, but not significant.

Here, we review recent advances in genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity and clonal dynamics in AML and their relevance to biology, clinical outcomes and therapeutic implications. Special attention is focused on somatic mutations affecting regulators of cytosine methylation, since these tend to occur early in disease evolution, reprogram the epigenome of hematopoietic stem cells, and are linked to unfavorable outcome.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in immune function are well established among laboratory rodents, with males typically having lower immunity than females. This sex difference may reflect the suppressive effects of testosterone on immune function. Because polygynous males generally have higher circulating testosterone concentrations than monogamous males, sex differences in immune function are hypothesized to be more pronounced among polygynous as compared to monogamous species. Sex differences in immune function have not been consistently observed among individually housed Microtus in the laboratory; thus, social interactions are hypothesized to be necessary for the expression of sex differences in immune function. We assessed the effect of differential housing conditions on humoral immunity and steroid hormone concentrations in polygynous meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, and monogamous prairie voles, M. ochrogaster. We examined humoral immunity by immunizing voles with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and measuring antibody production 5, 10, 15 and 30 days postimmunization. Overall, meadow voles mounted higher anti-KLH immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG responses than prairie voles, regardless of the housing condition. Sex differences in antibody production were only observed among meadow voles housed in pairs, in which females had higher anti-KLH IgM and IgG responses than males. Sex differences in antibody production were not observed among prairie voles or meadow voles housed individually. Sex and species differences in circulating oestradiol, testosterone, and corticosterone concentrations were not related to differences in humoral immunity. These data suggest that sex differences in immune function are more pronounced among polygynous species than monogamous species, but may be context dependent.},

On the other hand, interest in androgens as a possible treatment for some autoimmune diseases is growing. In the present study, some immunological parameters were evaluated in 26 patients with KS prior to androgen replacement treatment (ART) and the results were compared with those in 19 healthy control subjects. Patients were then treated with testosterone for 6 months and the pre- and post-treatment findings were compared. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3c and C4 were measured by nephelometry and lymphocyte subsets and CD4+/CD8+ ratios were examined by flow cytometry. IL-2 and IL-4 levels were measured by ELISA. Pretreatment levels of the serum IgA, IgG, IgM, IL-2 and IL-4 of the patients were higher than those of the controls and were all decreased significantly following ART. The pretreatment absolute numbers and percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD19+ cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratios of patients with KS were higher than those of the controls and were all decreased with ART. Percentages of CD8+ cells were increased significantly, while C3 and C4 levels were both significantly decreased after ART. It is concluded that the lack of testosterone in patients with KS enhances cellular and humoral immunity and that ART may suppress this.},

  abstract = {Minipuberty is a period of increased reproductive axis activity in infancy, which seems to be implicated in the postnatal development of male genital organs. Impaired thyroid function during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal complications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of hypothyroidism during pregnancy modulates the course of male minipuberty. We compared three matched groups of male infants: sons of women with hypothyroidism uncontrolled or poorly controlled during pregnancy (group A), male offspring of women treated over the entire pregnancy with adequate doses of levothyroxine (group B), and sons born to women with no evidence of thyroid disease (group C). Salivary levels of testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, progesterone, and 17hydroxyprogesterone, as well as urine concentrations of FSH and LH, were assessed once a month in the first 6 months of life, and once every two months between months 6 and 12. Gonadotropin and testosterone levels during the first 6 months of life were lower in group A than in groups B and C. Differences in testosterone and gonadotropin levels were accompanied by similar differences in penile length and testicular volume. Concentrations of the remaining hormones did not differ between the study groups. The obtained results suggest that untreated or undertreated maternal thyroid hypofunction in pregnancy has an inhibitory effect on postnatal activation of the hypothalamicpituitary-testicular axis and genital organ development in their male offspring.},

  abstract = {Cryptorchidism, or undescended testis, is a well-known risk factor for testicular cancer and impaired semen quality in adulthood, conditions which have their origins in early fetal and postnatal life. In human pregnancy, the interplay of testicular and placental hormones as well as local regulatory factors and control by the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis, lead to testicular descent by term. The normal masculine development may be disrupted by environmental factors or genetic defects and result in undescended testes. Minipuberty refers to the postnatal re-activation of the HP-testicular (T) axis after birth. During the first weeks of life, gonadotropin levels increase, followed by activation and proliferation of testicular Leydig, Sertoli and germ cells. Consequent rise in testosterone levels results in penile growth during the first months of life. Testicular size increases and testicular descent continues until three to five months of age. Insufficient HPT axis activation (e.g., hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) is often associated with undescended testis and therefore minipuberty is considered an important phase in the normal male reproductive development. Minipuberty provides a unique window of opportunity for the early evaluation of HPT axis function during early infancy. For cryptorchid boys, hormonal evaluation during minipuberty may give a hint of the underlying etiology and aid in the evaluation of the later risk of HPT axis dysfunction and impaired fertility. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the role of minipuberty in testicular development and descent.},

In general, women develop strongest immune responses and thus the proportion of infected individuals and the severity of many viral, bacterial or parasitic infections are increased in men. However, heightened immunity in women makes them more susceptible than men to autoimmunity and allergy. While sex differences in immunity are well documented, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these immunological differences, particularly in allergic asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways mediated by exacerbated type 2 immune responses. Sex differences have been reported in the incidence, prevalence and severity of asthma. While during childhood, males are more susceptible to asthma than females, there is a switch at the onset of puberty as for many other allergic diseases. This decrease of asthma incidence around puberty in males suggests that hormonal mediators could play a protective role in the susceptibility to allergic responses in male. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) have recently emerged as critical players in the initiation of allergic responses, but also in the resolution of parasitic infection, through their capacity to rapidly and potently produce type 2 cytokines. This review will cover the current understanding of the impact of sex-linked factors in allergic inflammation, with a particular focus on the impact of sex hormones on the development and function of tissue-resident ILC2.},

  abstract = {Establishment and maintenance of pregnancy represents a challenge for the maternal immune system since it has to defend against pathogens and tolerate paternal alloantigens expressed in fetal tissues. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, a subset of suppressor CD4+ T cells, play a dominant role in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance by preventing immune and autoimmune responses against self-antigens. Although localized mechanisms contribute to fetal evasion from immune attack, in the last few years it has been observed that Treg cells are essential in promoting fetal survival avoiding the recognition of paternal semi-allogeneic tissues by maternal immune system. Several functional studies have shown that unexplained infertility, miscarriage and pre-clampsia are often associated with deficit in Treg cell number and function while normal pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal forkhead-box-P3+ (FoxP3+) CD4+ Treg cells with fetal specificity. Some papers have been reported that the number of Treg cells persists at elevated levels long after delivery developing an immune regulatory memory against father's antigens, moreover these memory Treg cells rapidly proliferate during subsequent pregnancies, however, on the other hand, there are several evidence suggesting a clear decline of Treg cells number after delivery. Different factors such as cytokines, adipokines, pregnancy hormones and seminal fluid have immunoregulatory activity and influence the success of pregnancy by increasing Treg cell number and activity. The development of strategies capable of modulating immune responses toward fetal antigens through Treg cell manipulation, could have an impact on the induction of tolerance against fetal antigens during immune-mediated recurrent abortion.},

The (immuno) biology of postpartum breast cancer is poorly understood and, hence, it is unknown why postpartum breast cancer has an enhanced risk for metastasis or how it should be effectively targeted for improved survival. The poorer prognosis of women diagnosed within 10 years of a completed pregnancy is most often contributed to the effects of mammary gland involution. We will discuss the most recent data and mechanistic insights of the most important processes associated with involution and their role in the adverse effects of a postpartum diagnosis. We will also look into the effect of lactation on breast cancer outcome after diagnosis. In addition, we will discuss the available treatment strategies that are currently being used to treat postpartum breast cancer, keeping in mind the importance of fertility preservation in this group of young women. These additional insights might offer potential therapeutic options for the improved treatment of women with this specific condition.},

  abstract = {Background: Total and differential white blood cell counts are important for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected diseases. To facilitate the interpretation of total and differential white blood cell counts in pediatric patients, the present study investigated agedependent changes in total and differential white blood cell counts in healthy reference children. Methods: Data were obtained from the Pediatric Reference Intervals in China study (PRINCE), which aims to establish and verify pediatric reference intervals for Chinese children based on a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study from January 2017 to December 2018. Quantile curves were calculated using the generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale method. The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantile curves were calculated for both total and differential white blood counts. Percents of stacked area charts were used to demonstrate the proportions of differential white blood cells. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. Results: Both 50th and 97.5th quantiles of total white blood cell count and monocyte count were highest at birth, then rapidly decreased in the first 6 months of life; relatively slow reduction continued until 2 years of age. The lymphocyte count was low during infancy and increased to its highest level at 6 months of age; it then exhibited moderate and continuous reduction until approximately 9 years of age. The pattern of neutrophil count changed with age in a manner opposite to that of lymphocyte count. Besides, there were two inter-sections of lymphocyte count and neutrophil count during infancy and at approximately 5 years of age, based on locally weighted regression (LOESS) analysis. There were no apparent age-related changes in eosinophil or basophil counts. Conclusion: These data regarding age-related changes in total and differential white blood cell counts can be used to assess the health of pediatric patients and guide clinical decisions.},

These windows of activation recall the three windows of the ``Developmental Origin of Health and Disease'' (DOHaD) paradigm and may play a substantial role in several aspects of human development, such as growth, behavior, and neurodevelopment. From the second trimester of pregnancy there is a peak in gonadotropin levels, followed by a decrease toward term and complete suppression at birth. This is due to the negative feedback of placental estrogens. Studies have shown that in this prenatal HPG axis activation, gonadotropin levels display a sex-related pattern which plays a crucial role in sex differentiation of internal and external genitalia. Soon after birth, there is a new increase in LH, FSH, and sex hormone concentrations, both in males and females, due to HPG re-activation. This postnatal activation is known as ``minipuberty.'' The HPG axis activity in infancy demonstrates a pulsatile pattern with hormone levels similar to those of true puberty. We review the studies on the changes of these hormones in infancy and their influence on several aspects of future development, from linear growth to fertility and neurobehavior.},

Boys also have higher fractions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in early infancy, but the mechanisms for these sex-related differences are unknown. In the prospective FARMFLORA follow-up study of 23 boys and 25 girls, we investigated if these immunological differences remained at 8 years of age. We also examined if testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels at birth and at 8 years of age were associated with immune maturation. Immunological variables and androgen levels were examined and measured in blood samples obtained at birth, 3--5 days and at 8 years of age. Boys had higher proportions of CD5               +               and immature/transitional CD24               hi               CD38               hi               B cells, whereas girls had higher fractions of B cells with a memory phenotype at 8 years of age.

Among boys, higher cord blood DHT levels were associated with higher proportions of CD5               +               B cells in early infancy and at 8 years of life.

However, the role of sex in immune system aging is not well understood. Here, we characterize peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 172 healthy adults 22--93 years of age using ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and flow cytometry. These data reveal a shared epigenomic signature of aging including declining na{\"i}ve T cell and increasing monocyte and cytotoxic cell functions. These changes are greater in magnitude in men and accompanied by a male-specific decline in B-cell specific loci. Age-related epigenomic changes first spike around late-thirties with similar timing and magnitude between sexes, whereas the second spike is earlier and stronger in men. Unexpectedly, genomic differences between sexes increase after age 65, with men having higher innate and pro-inflammatory activity and lower adaptive activity.

Variation in primate immunity is such that major human pathogens - such as immunodeficiency viruses, herpesviruses and malaria-inducing species of Plasmodium - elicit striking differences in immune response between closely related species and within primate populations. These differences in immunity are the outcome of complex evolutionary processes that include interactions between the host, its pathogens and symbiont/commensal organisms. The success of some pathogens in establishing persistent infections in humans and other primates has been determined not just by the molecular evolution of the pathogen and its interactions with the host, but also by the evolution of primate behavior and ecology, microflora, immune factors and the evolution of other biological systems.To explore how interactions between primates and their pathogens have shaped their mutual molecular evolution, Primates, Pathogens and Evolution brings together research that explores comparative primate immune function, the emergence of major and neglected primate diseases, primate-microorganism molecular interactions, and related topics. This book will be of interest to anyone curious as to why infectious diseases manifest differently in humans and their closest relatives. It will be of particular interest to scholars specializing in human and non-human primate evolution, epidemiology and immunology, and disease ecology. Primates, Pathogens and Evolution offers an overview and discussion of current findings on differences in the molecular mechanics of primate immune response, as well as on pathogen-mediated primate evolution and human and non-human primate health.},

  abstract = {Six months of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is considered optimal for infant health, though globally most infants begin complementary feeding (CF) earlier---including among populations that practice prolonged breastfeeding. Two frameworks for understanding patterns of early CF emerge in the literature. In the first, maternal and infant needs trade-off, as ``maternal-centric'' factors---related to time and energy demands, reproductive investment, cultural influences, and structural barriers--- favor supplanting breastfeeding with earlier and increased CF. A second framework considers that ``infant-centric'' factors---related to infant energetic needs---favor CF before six months to supplement breastfeeding. We apply these two frameworks in examining early CF among the Tsimane---a high-fertility, high-mortality, forager-horticulturalist population residing in the Bolivian Amazon. Data were collected from a mixed-longitudinal sample of 161 Tsimane mother-infant pairs from August 2012--April 2013. Tsimane mothers generally reported introducing CF because of perceived infant needs. However, CF is introduced with continued intensive breastfeeding, and generally coupled with premastication. Risks of earlier CF relative to the minimum hazard (estimated at 5 births) were elevated for lower and higher parity mothers, but were significantly greater only after 9 births. Seventeen percent of mothers reported introducing CF because of low milk supply. Introducing CF because of low milk was most common from 0 to 3 months of age and among higher parity mothers, which may reflect physiological constraints. Maternal reproductive trade-offs and perceived infant needs may help explain the low prevalence of EBF to six months among other populations in which breastfeeding is not structurally or culturally constrained.},

Central to their function is their ability to be recruited to sites of infection, to recognize and phagocytose microbes, and then to kill pathogens through a combination of cytotoxic mechanisms. These include the production of reactive oxygen species, the release of antimicrobial peptides, and the recently discovered expulsion of their nuclear contents to form neutrophil extracellular traps. Here we discuss these primordial neutrophil functions, which also play key roles in tissue injury, by providing details of neutrophil cytotoxic functions and congenital disorders of neutrophils. In addition, we present more recent evidence that interactions between neutrophils and adaptive immune cells establish a feed-forward mechanism that amplifies pathologic inflammation. These newly appreciated contributions of neutrophils are described in the setting of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.},

The model posits affects of socioecology, reproductive history, maternal condition, and men's IFS. We test three hypotheses for why women may exceed their IFS despite experiencing socioeconomic development: (H(1) ) limited autonomy; (H(2) ) improved maternal condition; and (H(3) ) low returns on investments in embodied capital. METHODS: Women's reproductive histories and prospective fertility data were collected from 2002 to 2008 (n = 305 women). Semistructured interviews were conducted with Tsimane women to study the perceived value of parental investment (n = 76). Multiple regression, t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to test model predictions. RESULTS: Women's IFS is predicted by their socioecology, reproductive history, maternal condition, and husband's IFS. Hypotheses 2 and 3 are supported. Couples residing near town have smaller IFS (women = 3.75 {\textpm} 1.64; men = 3.87 {\textpm} 2.64) and less variance in IFS. However, the degree fertility exceeds IFS is inversely correlated with distance to town (Partial r = -0.189, df = 156, P = 0.018). Women living near town have greater maternal condition but 64\% value traditional skills over formal schooling and 88\% believe living in town is unfeasible. CONCLUSIONS: While reduced IFS is evident with socioeconomic development, fertility decline may not immediately follow. When perceived benefits of investment in novel forms of embodied capital are low, and somatic wealth and large kin networks persist as important components of fitness, fertility may remain high and increase if maternal condition improves.},

  abstract = {The sexes often differ in the reproductive trait limiting their fitness, an observation known as Bateman's principle. In many species, females are limited by their ability to produce eggs while males are limited by their ability to compete for and successfully fertilize those eggs. As well as promoting the evolution of sex-specific reproductive strategies, this difference may promote sex differences in other life-history traits due to their correlated effects. Sex differences in disease susceptibility and immune function are common. Two hypotheses based on Bateman's principle have been proposed to explain this pattern: that selection to prolong the period of egg production favors improved immune function in females, or that the expression of secondary sexual characteristics reduces immune function in males. Both hypotheses predict a relatively fixed pattern of reduced male immune function, at least in sexually mature individuals. An alternative hypothesis is that Bateman's principle does not dictate fixed patterns of reproductive investment, but favors phenotypically plastic reproductive strategies with males and females adaptively responding to variation in fitness-limiting resource availability. Under this hypothesis, neither sex is expected to possess intrinsically superior immune function, and immunological sex differences may vary in different environments. We demonstrate that sex-specific responses to experimental manipulation of fitness-limiting resources affects both the magnitude and direction of sex differences in immune function in Drosophila melanogaster. In the absence of sexual interactions and given abundant food, the immune function of adults was maximized in both sexes and there was no sex difference. Manipulation of food availability and sexual activity resulted in female-biased immune suppression when food was limited, and male-biased immune suppression when sexual activity was high and food was abundant. The immunological cost to males of increased sexual activity was found to be due in part to reduced time spent feeding. We suggest that for species similarly limited in their reproduction, phenotypic plasticity will be an important determinant of sex differences in immune function and other life-history traits.},

Known immune mechanisms in birds and mammals suggest that pathogen detection may be amplified in females, whereas in males, pathogen killing is amplified. We show that these immunological profiles emerge as distinct peaks on a fitness landscape defined by sensitivity-specificity and infection-immunopathology immune tradeoffs. What selection pressures might drive males and females towards separate peaks? Surprisingly, modeling immune trade-offs alone results in a pattern of sex differences that is the reverse of what is observed. By integrating these trade-offs into a life-history framework, where the schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment differs between the sexes, we find that increased age-specific infection and mortality risks during parental investment can push females towards the peak that aligns with empirical observations. Overall, our model suggests enhanced pathogen detection (in females) versus enhanced pathogen killing (in males) is best explained if shared immune tradeoffs interact with sex-specific reproductive schedules and risks. We suggest ways to test this framework empirically.},

  abstract = {Background: In primary Sj{\"o}gren's Syndrome (pSS), cutaneous vasculitis lesions (CVL) are extraglandular manifestations with an important clinical and prognostic impact and their early detection might contribute to the improvement of disease control and even patients' survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive potential of hematological elements in the development of CVL in pSS patients. Methods: In this single center, retrospective study, a total of 245 participants were included (124 pSS patients and 121 healthy controls). Complete blood count, inflammatory and immunological parameters were determined at the initial visit. pSS patients underwent a periodical follow-up program, when disease progression and response to therapy was monitored, including the emergence of CVL. Results: In pSS, leucocytes, lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, erythrocyte and platelet counts are significantly decreased compared to healthy subjects (p {$<$} 0.001), whereas cellular ratios: NLR, PLR, MLR, and immunological and inflammatory parameters are significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.001). A total of 34 patients with pSS (27.41\%) developed CVL during the follow-up period. The occurrence of CVL was positively correlated with neutrophil and platelet counts (p {$<$} 0.001), while for lymphocytes the correlation was negative (p {$<$} 0.001). Cellular ratios: NLR, PLR and MLR, and gammaglobulins also revealed significant positive correlations with the emergence of CVL in pSS (p {$<$} 0.001). The multivariate analysis confirmed the independent predictive character for CVL emergence in pSS for NLR (CI95\% 0.053--0.2, p {$<$} 0.002), PLR (CI95\% 0.001--0.003, p {$<$} 0.003), MLR (CI95\% 0.086--0.935, p {$<$} 0.019), and gammaglobulins (CI95\% 0.423--0.688, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: Standard hematological parameters, widely used in the assessment of pSS patients, such as NLR, PLR, MLR and gammaglobulins could become valid elements that might be used for the early detection of patients at risk for the development of CVL.},

  abstract = {Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that destroys thyroid cells by cell and antibody-mediated immune processes. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries. In contrast, worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is an inadequate dietary intake of iodine. This~disease is also known as chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The pathology of the disease involves the formation of antithyroid antibodies that attack the thyroid tissue, causing progressive fibrosis. The diagnosis is often challenging and may take time until later in the disease process. The most common laboratory findings demonstrate elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low levels of free thyroxine (fT4), coupled with increased antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. However, earlier on in the course of the disease, patients may exhibit signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of hyperthyroidism or normal values. This is because the destruction of the thyroid gland cells may be intermittent. Women are more often affected. The female-to-male ratio is at least 10:1. Although some sources cite diagnosis happening more so in the fifth decade of life, most women are diagnosed between the ages of 30 to 50 years. Conventional treatment is comprised of levothyroxine at the recommended dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg/day. The T4 converts to T3, which is the active form of thyroid hormone in the human body. Excessive supplementation can lead to deleterious and morbid effects, such as arrhythmias (the most common being atrial fibrillation) and osteoporosis. In this chapter, we review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of Hashimoto thyroiditis.},

Although, typically associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NADPH oxidase, primed neutrophils show enhanced responsiveness of exocytosis, NET formation, and chemotaxis. Phenotypic changes associated with priming also include activation of a subset of functions, including adhesion, transcription, metabolism, and rate of apoptosis. This review summarizes the breadth of phenotypic changes associated with priming and reviews current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind those changes. We conclude that the current definition of priming is too restrictive. Priming represents a combination of enhanced responsiveness and activated functions that regulate both adaptive and innate immune responses.},

Current explanations cannot account for this pattern, creating an obstacle for our understanding of infectious-disease outcomes and the incidence of autoimmune diseases. We offer an alternative explanation that relies on a fundamental difference between the sexes: maternity and the opportunities it creates for transmission of pathogens from mother to child (vertical transmission). Our explanation relies on a mathematical model of the co-evolution of host immunocompetence and pathogen virulence. Here, we show that when there is sufficient vertical transmission co-evolution leads women to defend strongly against temperate pathogens and men to defend weakly against aggressive pathogens, in keeping with medical observations. From a more applied perspective, we argue that limiting vertical transmission of infections would alleviate the disproportionate incidence of autoimmune diseases in women over evolutionary~time.},

Blood samples were collected just before and at 2, 4 and 10 weeks after MMR. While there were no sex differences before MMR and at week 10 after vaccination, levels of specific IgG determined by whole RV enzyme immunoassay were found to be significantly higher in males at weeks 2 and 4, suggesting brisker onset of recall AMI. Analysis of RV protein-specific IgG by immunoblot assays also revealed that while there were no notable sex differences in the distribution of E1-specific antibodies, more males produced E2-specific antibodies whereas more females produced C-specific antibodies after immunisation. Analysis of CMI with whole inactivated RV and a panel of RV synthetic peptides in lymphocyte proliferation assays revealed a brisker onset of CMI in males which paralleled that observed for AMI. The numbers of RV antigens recognised by males were significantly higher at weeks 2 and 4. Also, mean and median stimulation indices measured at weeks 2 and 4 for certain peptides, including two known to contain overlapping antibody neutralisation domains and T-cell epitopes, E1(213-239) and E1(254-285), were also found to be significantly higher in male subjects. These observations suggest that there are hormonal influences on RV-specific immunity which might result in differential handling of RV and, hence, may partially explain why females are more predisposed to adverse outcomes of rubella infection and immunisation.},

Methods{\enspace} A cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted among pre-eclamptic women in Kosti Maternity Hospital from September to December 2022. Forty-five pre-eclamptic women were enrolled in this study and were classified according to the WHO classification of PE into mild PE (23 PE patients) and severe PE (22 PE patients). Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering medical history and clinical assessment. A blood sample was taken from each participant for measurements of the complete blood count (CBC), liver functions test (LFT) with enzymes, renal functions test (RFT) with electrolytes, and uric acid by standard techniques. Results{\enspace} NLR was found to be statistically significantly higher in mothers with severe PE (6.3--9.9) than in those with mild PE (2.2--1.5) (p-value 0.048). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was significantly higher in women with severe PE than in those with mild PE (p-value\,=\,0.02).

There is controversial evidence on whether/how the age at disease onset affects their clinical phenotype. We here investigate the relationship between age at disease onset and symptoms in a large cohort of SSc patients (lcSSc, dcSSc and SSc-overlap syndromes). Methods. Clinical data of the registry of the German Network for Systemic Scleroderma including 3281 patients were evaluated and subdivided into three age groups at disease onset ({$<$}40 years, 40--60 years, {$>$}60 years). Results. Among all SSc patients, 24.5\% developed their first non-Raynaud phenomenon symptoms at the age {$<$}40 years, and 22.5\% were older than 60 years of age. In particular, older patients at onset developed the lcSSc subset significantly more often. Furthermore, they had pulmonary hypertension more often, but digital ulcerations less often. Remarkably, the course of the disease was more rapidly progressing in the older cohort ({$>$}60 years), except for gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal involvement. No significant difference was found for the use of corticosteroids. However, significantly, fewer patients older than 60 years received immunosuppressive treatment. Conclusion. In this large registry,  25\% of patients developed SSc at an age above 60 years with an increased frequency of lcSSc. In this age group, an onset of internal organ involvement was significantly accelerated across all three subsets. These findings suggest that, in the elderly cohort, more frequent follow-up examinations are required for an earlier detection of organ complications.},

Here we investigated the effects of minipuberty on male and female infant human thymic tissue in order to verify if this initial transient increase in sex hormones - along the first six months of life - could affect thymic transcriptional network regulation and               AIRE               expression. Gene co-expression network analysis for differentially expressed genes and miRNA-target analysis revealed sex differences in thymic tissue during minipuberty, but such differences were not detected in the thymic tissue of infants aged 7--18 months, i.e. the non-puberty group.               AIRE               expression was essentially the same in both sexes in minipuberty and in non-puberty groups, as assessed by genomic and immunohistochemical assays. However,               AIRE               -interactors networks showed several differences in all groups regarding gene-gene expression correlation. Therefore, minipuberty and genomic mechanisms interact in shaping thymic sexual dimorphism along the first six months of life.},

  abstract = {There is a paucity of data on the energetic demands of human immune functions, despite the fact that both clinical medicine and evolutionary biology would benefit from further clarification of these costs. To better understand the energetic requirements of mounting a mild immune response, as well as some of the major hormonal changes underlying these metabolic changes, we examined changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and hormones during and after respiratory tract infection in young adult men. An epidemiologic passive detection design was used to recruit 25 nonfebrile subjects naturally infected with respiratory tract pathogens. Symptomology, percent body fat, RMR, salivary testosterone and cortisol, and other information were collected at a minimum of three time points during and after convalescence. Comparisons of the differences in RMR, testosterone, and cortisol between sampling days within individualcases were made using paired t-tests. Participants experienced 8\% higher RMR during illness, and a subset of these men experienced a mean increase greater than 14\%. The participants also experienced 10\% lower testosterone levels during illness, and a subset of these participants experienced a mean decrease of 30\%, although cortisol levels did notchange significantly. These results document elevated RMR following natural pathogen exposure in adult humans, emonstrating that even mild immune reactions can elicit significant increases in energy expenditure. Understanding the costs of immunity and the immunomodulatory actions of hormones are central to understanding the role of immunity in human life history evolution. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, high testosterone levels can also compromise survivorship by increasing risk of prostate cancer, production of oxygen radicals, risk of injury due to hormonally-augmented behaviors such as aggression, violence and risk taking, reduced tissue and organ maintenance, negative energy balance from adipose tissue catabolism, and suppression of immune functions. Here, I briefly discuss how inter- and intra-individual variation in human male testosterone levels is likely an adaptive mechanism that facilitates the allocation of metabolic resources, particularly in response to injury, illness or otherwise immune activation. Maintaining low testosterone levels in resource-limited and/or high pathogen-risk environments may avoid some immunosuppression and suspend energetically-expensive anabolic functions. Augmenting testosterone levels in the presence of fertile and receptive mates, areas of high food resource availability, and low disease risk habitats will function to maximize lifetime reproductive success.},

  abstract = {Although neutrophils are known to be fundamental in controlling innate immune responses, their role in regulating adaptive immunity is just starting to be appreciated. We report that human neutrophils exposed to pregnancy hormones progesterone and estriol promote the establishment of maternal tolerance through the induction of a population of CD4+ T cells displaying a GARP+CD127loFOXP3+ phenotype following antigen activation. Neutrophil-induced T (niT) cells produce IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF and promote vessel growth in vitro. Neutrophil depletion during murine pregnancy leads to abnormal development of the fetal-maternal unit and reduced empbryo development, with placental architecture displaying poor trophoblast invasion and spiral artery development in the maternal decidua, accompanied by significantly attenuated niT cell numbers in draining lymph nodes. Using CD45 congenic cells, we show that induction of niT cells and their regulatory function occurs via transfer of apoptotic neutrophil-derived proteins, including forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1), to T cells. Unlike in women with healthy pregnancies, neutrophils from blood and placental samples of preeclamptic women fail to induce niT cells as a direct consequence of their inability to transfer FOXO1 to T cells. Finally, neutrophil-selective FOXO1 knockdown leads to defective placentation and compromised embryo development, similar to that resulting from neutrophil depletion. These data define a nonredundant function of neutrophil-T cell interactions in the regulation of vascularization at the maternal-fetal interface.},

Concomitantly, increased numbers of LDGs are associated with the severity of many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Recent studies, with the help of advanced transcriptomic technologies, demonstrated that LDGs were a mixed cell population composed of immature subset and mature subset, and these two subsets showed different pathogenic features. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the composition, origin, and pathogenic properties of LDGs in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and discuss potential medical interventions targeting LDGs.},

  abstract = {Introduction{\enspace} Adolescent pregnancy is a known health risk to mother and child. Statements and reports of health outcomes typically group mothers under 20 years old together. Few studies examined this risk at a finer age resolution, none of them comprehensively, and with differing results. Methods{\enspace} We analysed Demographic and Health Surveys data from 2004 to 2018 in sub-\-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia, on firstborn children of mothers 25 years old or younger. We examined the association between maternal age and stillbirths, and neonatal mortality rate (NNMR), infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-\-5 mortality rate (U5MR), using mixed-\-effects logistic regression adjusting for major demographic variables and exploring the impact of maternal health-\-seeking. Results{\enspace} In both regions and across all endpoints, mortality rates of children born to mothers aged {$<$}16 years, 16--17 years and 18--19 years at first birth were about 2--4 times, 1.5--2 times and 1.2--1.5 times higher, respectively, than among firstborn children of mothers aged 23--25. Absolute mortality rates declined over time, but the age gradient remained similar across time periods and regions. Adjusting for rural/urban residence and maternal education, in SSA in 2014--2018 having a {$<$}16-\-year-\-old mother was associated with ORs of 3.71 (95\% CI: 2.50 to 5.51) for stillbirth, 1.92 (1.60--2.30) for NNMR, 2.13 (1.85--2.46) for IMR and 2.39 (2.13--2.68) for U5MR, compared with having a mother aged 23--25. In South Asia, in 2014--2018 ORs were 5.12 (2.85--9.20) for stillbirth, 2.46 (2.03--2.97) for NNMR, 2.62 (2.22--3.08) for IMR and 2.59 (2.22--3.03) for U5MR. Part of the effect on NNMR and IMR may be mediated by a lower maternal health-\-seeking rate. Conclusions{\enspace} Adolescent pregnancy is associated with dramatically worse child survival and mitigated by health-\-seeking behaviour, likely reflecting a combination of biological and social factors. Refining maternal age reporting will avoid masking the increased risk to children born to very young adolescent mothers. Collection of additional biological and social data may better reveal mediators of this relationship. Targeted intervention strategies to reduce unintended pregnancy at earlier ages may also improve child survival.},

  abstract = {Background: Average profiles of salivary progesterone in women vary significantly at the inter- and intrapopulation level as a function of age and acute energetic conditions related to energy intake, energy expenditure, or a combination of both. In addition to acute stressors, baseline progesterone levels differ among populations. The causes of such chronic differences are not well understood, but it has been hypothesised that they may result from varying tempos of growth and maturation and, by implication, from diverse environmental conditions encountered during childhood and adolescence. Methods and Findings: To test this hypothesis, we conducted a migrant study among first- and second-generation Bangladeshi women aged 19-39 who migrated to London, UK at different points in the life-course, women still resident in Bangladesh, and women of European descent living in neighbourhoods similar to those of the migrants in London (total n = 227). Data collected included saliva samples for radioimmunoassay of progesterone, anthropometrics, and information from questionnaires on diet, lifestyle, and health. Results from multiple linear regression, controlled for anthropometric and reproductive variables, show that women who spend their childhood in conditions of low energy expenditure, stable energy intake, good sanitation, low immune challenges, and good health care in the UK have up to 103\% higher levels of salivary progesterone and an earlier maturation than women who develop in less optimal conditions in Sylhet, Bangladesh (F9,178=5.05, p {$<$} 0.001, standard error of the mean=0.32; adjusted R2 = 0.16). Our results point to the period prior to puberty as a sensitive phase when changes in environmental conditions positively impact developmental tempos such as menarcheal age (F2,81 = 3.21, p = 0.03) and patterns of ovarian function as measured using salivary progesterone (F2,81 = 3.14, p = 0.04). Conclusions: This research demonstrates that human females use an extended period of the life cycle prior to reproductive maturation to monitor their environment and to modulate reproductive steroid levels in accordance with projected conditions they might encounter as adults. Given the prolonged investment of human pregnancy and lactation, such plasticity (extending beyond any intrauterine programming) enables a more flexible and finely tuned adjustment to the potential constraints or opportunities of the later adult environment. This research is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a postuterine developmental component to variation in reproductive steroid levels in women. {\copyright} 2007 N{\'u}{\~n}ez-de la Mora et al.},

  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in immune function is a common pattern in vertebrates and also in a number of invertebrates. Most often, females are more 'immunocompetent' than males. The underlying causes are explained by either the role of immunosuppressive substances, such as testosterone, or by fundamental differences in male and female life histories. Here, we investigate some of the main predictions of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) in a comparative framework using mammals. We focus specifically on the prediction that measures of sexual competition across species explain the observed patterns of variation in sex-specific immunocompetence within species. Our results are not consistent with the ICHH, but we do find that female mammals tend to have higher white blood cell counts (WBC), with some further associations between cell counts and longevity in females. We also document positive covariance between sexual dimorphism in immunity, as measured by a subset of WBC, and dimorphism in the duration of effective breeding. This is consistent with the application of 'Bateman's principle' to immunity, with females maximizing fitness by lengthening lifespan through greater investment in immune defences. Moreover, we present a meta-analysis of insect immunity, as the lack of testosterone in insects provides a means to investigate Bateman's principle for immunity independently of the ICHH. Here, we also find a systematic female bias in the expression of one of the two components of insect immune function that we investigated (phenoloxidase). From these analyses, we conclude that the mechanistic explanations of the ICHH lack empirical support. Instead, fitness-related differences between the sexes are potentially sufficient to explain many natural patterns in immunocompetence. {\copyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

While the relative contributions of sex steroids shift from maternal ovaries and adrenals to the fetoplacental unit, other maternal tissues such as pituitary and liver respond to increasing concentrations of estrogen and secrete increasing amounts of prolactin and sex-hormone-binding globulin. To determine longitudinal changes in circulating maternal hormones, we collected blood from 60 women on three occasions during their pregnancies. We observed a 1.7-fold increase in testosterone concentration in serum; concentrations of sex-hormone-binding globulin in serum rose 5.6-fold. The major increase (6.8-fold) in estradiol in serum occurred within the first 16 weeks, followed by a further 4.8-fold increase by term. Mean concentrations of progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and androstenedione in serum increased 11.9-, 3-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, whereas concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) fell by 50\%. Mean serum prolactin concentrations increased 3.8-fold during the first trimester and by a similar amount during the final 24 weeks of pregnancy.

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} Neutrophils and lymphocytes represent the larger percentage of all white blood cells, they vary with age, with a progressive increase of the ratio in the first years of life, and then tend to remain at similar levels in steady state condition during adult age. Neutrophils to lymphocytes-ratio (NL-ratio) was proposed as an effective and lowcost marker to monitor and predict the evolution of several clinical conditions. The main objective of the study is to analyze its temporal trend variation, over twenty years' follow-up, according to age, sex, and main clinical diagnosis, in a large representative Italian population. Methods{\enspace} The InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry list of two towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998, and last follow-up visits were made in 2015-18. 1343 out of the 1453 participants enrolled were included, and consented to donate a blood sample. All subjects were assessed and followed for lifestyle, clinical condition, physical performance, and underwent an instrumental diagnostic session. Results{\enspace} The NL-ratio showed a statistically significant interaction between birth-cohort and time of the study (p-value\,=\,0.005). A gender dimorphism was recognized in the neutrophils absolute count and in the NL-ratio. Moreover, in female participants only, those who reported CHF had lower neutrophil-count and NL-ratio; whereas an increase in creatinine clearance was directly associated with NL-ratio. In male subjects, an increase of BMI was inversely associated with both NL-ratio and neutrophils-count during the follow-up; a similar association but in the opposite direction was observed in female participants.},

  abstract = {Methods. The effect of pregnancy on the risk of RA was examined by comparing women enrolled in 2 studies: a study of RA in NAN patients and their unaffected relatives; and NAN patients with RA and unrelated healthy NAN controls enrolled in a study of autoimmunity. All participants completed questionnaires detailing their reproductive history. Results. Patients with RA (n = 168) and controls (n = 400) were similar overall in age, education, shared epitope frequency, number of pregnancies, age at first pregnancy, smoking, and breastfeeding history. In multivariate analysis, for women who had {$\geq$} 6 births the OR for developing RA was 0.43 (95\% CI 0.21-0.87) compared with women who had 1-2 births (p = 0.046); for women who gave birth for the first time after age 20 the OR for developing RA was 0.33 (95\% CI 0.16-0.66) compared with women whose first birth occurred at age {$\leq$} 17 (p = 0.001). The highest risk of developing RA was in the first postpartum year (OR 3.8; 95\% CI 1.45-9.93) compared with subsequent years (p = 0.004). Conclusion. In this unique population, greater parity significantly reduced the odds of RA; an early age at first birth increased the odds, and the postpartum period was confirmed as high risk for RA onset. The protective effect of repeated exposure to the ameliorating hormonal and immunological changes of pregnancy may counterbalance the effect of early exposure to the postpartum reversal of these changes.

The relationship between autoimmunity and reproduction is bidirectional. This review only addresses the impact of pregnancy on autoimmune diseases and not the influence of autoimmunity on pregnancy development. Th17/Th1-type cells are aggressive and pathogenic in many autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases. The immunology of pregnancy underlies the role of Th2-type cytokines to maintain the tolerance of the mother towards the fetal semi-allograft. Non-specific factors, including hormonal changes, favor a switch to Th2-type cytokine profile. In pregnancy Th2, Th17/Th2 and Treg cells accumulate in the decidua but may also be present in the mother's circulation and can regulate autoimmune responses influencing the progression of autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous factors may influence Schistosoma infection intensity and prevalence within endemic communities, including exposure-related factors such as local environment and behaviour, and factors relating to susceptibility to infection such as immunology and genetics. While animal studies performed in the laboratory can be tightly controlled, human populations are highly heterogeneous, varying according to demographic characteristics, genetic background and exposure to infection. The heterogeneous nature of human water contact behaviour in particular makes it difficult to distinguish between a lack of cercarial exposure and reduced susceptibility to infection as the cause for low levels of infection in the field. Methods and Principal Findings: In this study we investigate risk factors for Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community receiving treatment as part of a multi-disciplinary longitudinal reinfection study. More specifically, we examine the influence that age, sex and ethnic background have on susceptibility to reinfection after antihelminth drug treatment, but use individual estimates of cercarial exposure and multivariable methods in an attempt to remove noise created by environmental and behavioural heterogeneities. We then investigate whether schistosome-specific IgE immune responses could account for any remaining variations in susceptibility to reinfection. Our findings suggest that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, as opposed to biological differences in susceptibility to infection. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, however, and appeared linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1 (formerly Sm22.6), which itself was significantly related to resistance to reinfection. Conclusions: This study highlights the benefit of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings; it allows the ecology of a population to be understood and thus more robust conclusions to be made.},

  abstract = {Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis happens in 3 phases during life. The first phase is during fetal life and is only separated from the second phase, called minipuberty, by the high concentration of placental hormones at birth. The third period of activation of the HPG axis is puberty and is well-described. Minipuberty consists of the neonatal activation of the HPG axis, mainly in the first 1--6 months, where the resulting high levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids induce the maturation of sexual organs in both sexes. With gonadal activation, testosterone levels rise in boys with peak levels after 1--3 months, which results in penile and testicular growth. In girls, gonadal activation leads to follicular maturation and a fluctuating increase in estrogen levels, with more controversy regarding the actual influence on the target tissue. The regulation of the HPG axis is complex, involving many biological and environmental factors. Only a few of these have known effects. Many details of this complex interaction of factors remain to be elucidated in order to understand the mechanisms underlying the first postnatal activation of the HPG axis as well as mechanisms shutting down the HPG axis, resulting in the hormonal quiescence observed between minipuberty and puberty. Minipuberty allows for the maturation of sexual organs and forms a platform for future fertility, but the long-term significance is still not absolutely clear. However, it provides a window of opportunity in the early detection of differences of sexual development, offering the possibility of initiating early medical treatment in some cases.},

  abstract = {Why do males and females often differ in their ability to cope with infection? Beyond physiological mechanisms, it has recently been proposed that life-history theory could explain immune differences from an adaptive point of view in relation to sex-specific reproductive strategies. However, a point often overlooked is that the benefits of immunity, and possibly the costs, depend not only on the host genotype but also on the presence and the phenotype of pathogens. To address this issue we developed an adaptive dynamic model that includes host--pathogen population dynamics and host sexual reproduction. Our model predicts that, although different reproductive strategies, following Bateman's principle, are not enough to select for different levels of immunity, males and females respond differently to further changes in the characteristics of either sex. For example, if males are more exposed to infection than females (e.g. for behavioural reasons), it is possible to see them evolve lower immunocompetence than females. This and other counterintuitive results highlight the importance of ecological feedbacks in the evolution of immune defences. While this study focuses on sex-specific natural selection, it could easily be extended to include sexual selection and thus help to understand the interplay between the two processes.},

  abstract = {During pregnancy, it is evolutionary advantageous for inflammatory immune responses that might lead to fetal rejection to be reduced and anti-inflammatory responses that promote transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus to be increased. Hormones modulate the immunological shift that occurs during pregnancy. Estrogens, including estradiol and estriol, progesterone, and glucocorticoids increase over the course of pregnancy and affect transcriptional signaling of inflammatory immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface and systemically. During pregnancy, the reduced activity of natural killer cells, inflammatory macrophages, and helper T cell type 1 (Th1) cells and production of inflammatory cytokines, combined with the higher activity of regulatory T cells and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, affects disease pathogenesis. The severity of diseases caused by inflammatory responses (e.g., multiple sclerosis) is reduced and the severity of diseases that are mitigated by inflammatory responses (e.g., influenza and malaria) is increased during pregnancy. For some infectious diseases, elevated inflammatory responses that are necessary to control and clear a pathogen have a negative consequence on the outcome of pregnancy. The bidirectional interactions between hormones and the immune system contribute to both the outcome of pregnancy and female susceptibility to disease.},

Maternal circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, are negatively correlated to maternal adiposity and fetal growth, suggesting that maternal adiponectin may limit fetal growth.                                                     Here we report that chronic administration of adiponectin to pregnant mice inhibits placental insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, down-regulates the activity and expression of key placental nutrient transporters, and decreases fetal growth.                                                     We have identified a novel physiological mechanism by which the endocrine functions of maternal adipose tissue influence fetal growth by altering placental function.                                                     These findings may help us better understand the factors determining birth weight in normal pregnancies and in pregnancy complications associated with altered maternal adiponectin levels such as obesity and gestational diabetes.                                                        ,                             Abstract{\enspace}               Maternal adiponectin levels are inversely correlated to birth weight, suggesting that maternal adiponectin limits fetal growth. We hypothesized that full-length adiponectin (fADN) infusion in pregnant mice down-regulates placental amino acid transporters and decreases fetal growth. Starting at embryonic day (E) 14.5, fADN (0.62 {\textpm} 0.02 {$\mu$}g (g body weight)               -1               day               -1               ,               n               = 7) or vehicle (control,               n               = 9) were infused in pregnant C57/BL6 mice by mini-osmotic pump. At E18.5, dams were killed and placental homogenates and trophoblast plasma membrane (TPM) vesicles were prepared. Infusion of fADN elevated maternal serum fADN by 4-fold and decreased fetal weights by 18\%. Adiponectin receptor 2, but not adiponectin receptor 1, was expressed in TPM. fADN infusion decreased TPM System A (--56\%,               P               {$<$} 0.001) and System L amino acid transporter activity (--50\%,               P               {$<$} 0.03). TPM protein expression of SNAT1, 2 and 4 (System A amino acid transporter isoforms) and LAT1 and LAT2, but not CD98, (System L amino acid transporter isoforms) was down-regulated by fADN infusion. To identify possible mechanisms underlying these changes we determined the phosphorylation of proteins in signalling pathways known to regulate placental amino acid transporters. fADN decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (Tyr-608), Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473), S6 kinase 1 (Thr-389), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (Thr-37/46 and Thr-70) and ribosomal protein S6 (Ser-235/236) and increased the phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {$\alpha$} (PPAR{$\alpha$}) (Ser-21) in the placenta. These data suggest that maternal adiponectin decreases fetal growth by down-regulation of placental amino acid transporters, which limits fetal nutrient availability. This effect may be mediated by inhibition of insulin/IGF-I and mTOR signalling pathways, which are positive regulators of placental amino acid transporters. We have identified a novel physiological mechanism by which the endocrine functions of maternal adipose tissue influence fetal growth.},

Objective: To compare morbidity and mortality before and after widespread implementation of national vaccine recommendations for 13 vaccine-preventable diseases for which recommendations were in place prior to 2005. Design, Setting, and Participants: For the United States, prevaccine baselines were assessed based on representative historical data from primary sources and were compared to the most recent morbidity (2006) and mortality (2004) data for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella (including congenital rubella syndrome), invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), acute hepatitis B, hepatitis A, varicella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and smallpox. Main Outcome Measures: Number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for 13 vaccine-preventable diseases. Estimates of the percent reductions from baseline to recent were made without adjustment for factors that could affect vaccine-preventable disease morbidity, mortality, or reporting. Results: A greater than 92\% decline in cases and a99\%or greater decline in deaths due to diseases prevented by vaccines recommended before 1980 were shown for diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, and tetanus. Endemic transmission of poliovirus and measles and rubella viruses has been eliminated in the United States; smallpox has been eradicated worldwide. Declines were 80\% or greater for cases and deaths of most vaccine-preventable diseases targeted since 1980 including hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, Hib, and varicella. Declines in cases and deaths of invasive S pneumoniae were 34\% and 25\%, respectively. Conclusions: The number of cases of most vaccine-preventable diseases is at an all time low; hospitalizations and deaths have also shown striking decreases. {\copyright}2007 American Medical Association.

  abstract = {Human reproduction is energetically costly, even more so than other primates. In this review, we consider how the energy cost of physical activity impacts reproductive tasks. Daily energy expenditure appears to be constrained, leading to trade-offs between activity and reproduction expenditures in physically active populations. High workloads can lead to suppression of basal metabolic rate and low gestational weight gain during pregnancy and longer interbirth intervals. These responses lead to variation in fertility, including age at first reproduction and interbirth interval. The influence of energetics is evident even in industrialized populations, where cultural and economic factors predominate. With the decoupling of skills acquisition from food procurement, extrasomatic resources and investment in individual offspring becomes very costly. The result is greater investment in fewer offspring. We present a summary of age at first reproduction and interbirth interval trends across a diverse, global sample representing 44 countries and two natural fertility populations. While economic factors impact fertility, women in energy-rich, industrialized populations are capable of greater reproductive output than women in energy-stressed populations. Thus, energetic factors can be disentangled from cultural and economic impacts on fertility. Future research should focus on objective measurements of energy intake, energy expenditure, and physical activity in a broader sample of populations to elucidate the role of energetics in shaping reproductive outcomes and health.},

Methods: We used serial serum samples from 71 pregnant women (25 primiparous, 25 multiparous, and 21 with two consecutive pregnancies) with natural, complication-free pregnancies and a healthy offspring at term who participated in a population-based screening trial for congenital infections in Finland between January 1st, 1988 and June 30, 1989 and provided a blood sample in each trimester. Results: Hormone levels were more strongly correlated between consecutive trimesters of a pregnancy than between the 1st and 3rd trimester (e.g., estradiol, rT1 vs. T2 = 0.51 and rT2 vs. T3 = 0.60, p {$<$} 0.01; rT1 vs. T3 = 0.32, p {$<$} 0. 05). Concentrations of sRANKL remained stable throughout gestation, whereas estradiol, estrone, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin, and osteoprotegerin increased throughout pregnancy. First trimester hormone concentrations explained less of the variation in the third trimester on their own than second trimester hormone levels (e.g. estradiol R2T1 = 16 \% and R2T2 = 42 \%). Addition of maternal (e.g., smoking) and/or child characteristics (e.g., sex) improved the accuracy of the 3rd trimester estimates for some of the hormones. Conclusions: One hormone measurement in early pregnancy, in conjunction with maternal and fetal characteristics, permits estimation of 3rd trimester hormone concentrations. Therefore, single hormone measurements available from maternity cohorts are suitable to quantify hormone exposure during pregnancy. To our knowledge, we provide the first data on correlations between hormone concentrations both across trimesters of a single pregnancy, as well as between two subsequent pregnancies.},

However, it is yet unclear whether sex hormones are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we analysed sex hormone levels (estradiol and testosterone) of male and female COVID-19 patients (n = 50) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in comparison to control non-COVID-19 patients at the ICU (n = 42), non-COVID-19 patients with the most prevalent comorbidity (coronary heart diseases) present within the COVID-19 cohort (n = 39) and healthy individuals (n = 50). We detected significantly elevated estradiol levels in critically ill male COVID-19 patients compared to all control cohorts. Testosterone levels were significantly reduced in critically ill male COVID-19 patients compared to control cohorts. No statistically significant differences in sex hormone levels were detected in critically ill female COVID-19 patients, albeit similar trends towards elevated estradiol levels were observed. Linear regression analysis revealed that among a broad range of cytokines and chemokines analysed, IFN-{$\gamma$} levels are positively associated with estradiol levels in male and female COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, male COVID-19 patients with elevated estradiol levels were more likely to receive ECMO treatment. Thus, we herein identified that disturbance of sex hormone metabolism might present a hallmark in critically ill male COVID-19 patients.},

  abstract = {How the semi-allogeneic fetus is tolerated by the maternal immune system remains a fascinating phenomenon. Despite extensive research activity in this field, the mechanisms underlying fetal tolerance are still not well understood. However, there are growing evidences that immune-immune interactions as well as immune-endocrine interactions build up a complex network of immune regulation that ensures fetal survival within the maternal uterus. In the present review, we aim to summarize emerging research data from our and other laboratories on immune modulating properties of pregnancy hormones with a special focus on progesterone, estradiol, and human chorionic gonadotropin. These pregnancy hormones are critically involved in the successful establishment, maintenance, and termination of pregnancy. They suppress detrimental maternal alloresponses while promoting tolerance pathways. This includes the reduction of the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages as well as the blockage of natural killer cells, T and B cells. Pregnancy hormones also support the proliferation of pregnancy supporting uterine killer cells, retain tolerogenic DCs, and efficiently induce regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, they are involved in the recruitment of mast cells and Treg cells into the fetal-maternal interface contributing to a local accumulation of pregnancy-protective cells. These findings highlight the importance of endocrine factors for the tolerance induction during pregnancy and encourage further research in the field. {\copyright} 2014 Schumacher, Costa and Zenclussen.},

Here, we estimated the abundance of the primary immune cell types throughout all tissues in the human body. We conducted a literature survey and integrated data from multiplexed imaging and methylome-based deconvolution. We also considered cellular mass to determine the distribution of immune cells in terms of both number and total mass. Our results indicate that the immune system of a reference 73 kg man consists of 1.8 {\texttimes} 10               12               cells (95\% CI 1.5--2.3 {\texttimes} 10               12               ), weighing 1.2 kg (95\% CI 0.8--1.9). Lymphocytes constitute 40\% of the total number of immune cells and 15\% of the mass and are mainly located in the lymph nodes and spleen. Neutrophils account for similar proportions of both the number and total mass of immune cells, with most neutrophils residing in the bone marrow. Macrophages, present in most tissues, account for 10\% of immune cells but contribute nearly 50\% of the total cellular mass due to their large size. The quantification of immune cells within the human body presented here can serve to understand the immune function better and facilitate quantitative modeling of this vital system.},

  abstract = {Background: Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets need to be determined in a large, urban, minority-predominant cohort of healthy children to serve as suitable control subjects for the interpretation of the appearance of these cells in several disease conditions, notably pediatric HIV-1 infection. Objective: We sought to determine the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in healthy urban-dwelling infants, children, and adolescents in the United States. Methods: Lymphocyte subsets were determined by means of 3-color flow cytometry in a cross-sectional study of 807 HIV-unexposed children from birth through 18 years of age. Results: Cell-surface marker analysis demonstrated that age was an extremely important variable in 24 lymphocyte subset distributions measured as percentages or absolute counts-eg, the CD4 (helper) T cell, CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell, CD19 B cell, CD4CD45RACD62L (naive helper) T cell, CD3CD4CD45RO (memory helper) T cell, CD8HLA-DRCD38 (activated cytotoxic) T cell, and CD8CD28 (activation primed cytotoxic) T cell. The testing laboratory proved to be an important variable, indicating the need for using the same laboratory or group of laboratories to assay an individual's blood over time and to assay control and ill or treated populations. Sex and race-ethnicity were much less important. Conclusion: The results of this study provide a control population for assessment of the effects of HIV infection on the normal development and distribution of lymphocyte subsets in children of both sexes, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds from birth through 18 years of age in an urban population. This study's findings will also prove invaluable in interpreting the immune changes in children with many other chronic diseases, such as primary immunodeficiency, malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma.},

  abstract = {Sexual risk-taking and reproductive morbidity are common among rapidly modernizing populations with little material wealth, limited schooling, minimal access to modern contraception and healthcare, and gendered inequalities in resource access that limit female autonomy in cohabiting relationships. Few studies have examined how modernization influences sexual risk-taking and reproductive health early in demographic transition. Tsimane are a natural fertility population of Bolivian forager-farmers; they are not urbanized, reside in small-scale villages, and lack public health infrastructure. We test whether modernization is associated with greater sexual risk-taking, report prevalence of gynecological morbidity (GM), and test whether modernization, sexual risk-taking and parity are associated with greater risk of GM. Data were collected from 2002-2010 using interviews, clinical exams, and laboratory analysis of cervical cells. We find opposing effects of modernization on both sexual risk-taking and risk of GM. Residential proximity to town and Spanish fluency are associated with greater likelihood of men's infidelity, and with number of lifetime sexual partners for men and women. However, for women, literacy is associated with delayed sexual debut after controlling for town proximity. Fifty-five percent of women present at least one clinical indicator of GM (n = 377); 48\% present inflammation of cervical cells, and in 11\% the inflammation results from sexually transmitted infection (trichomoniasis). Despite having easier access to modern healthcare, women residing near town experience greater likelihood of cervical inflammation and trichomoniasis relative to women in remote villages; women who are fluent in Spanish are also more likely to present trichomoniasis relative to women with moderate or no fluency. However, literate women experience lower likelihood of trichomoniasis. Parity has no effect on risk of GM. Our results suggest a net increase in risk of reproductive morbidity among rapidly modernizing, resource-stressed populations.},

Here we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titres, plasma cytokines and blood-cell phenotyping in patients with moderate COVID-19 who had not received immunomodulatory medications. Male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. By contrast, female patients had more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients' age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. By contrast, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression in female patients, but not in male patients. These findings provide a possible explanation for the observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide an important basis for the development of a sex-based approach to the treatment and care of male and female patients with COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Females and males differ in the energy consumption and nutritional requirements which are based on the interactions between environmental factors and sex hormones (1). The studies in early 1940s ascertained that females have enhanced capability of producing antibodies (2, 3). This enhanced immune reactivity in females helps mount an effective resistance to infection and therefore females are less susceptible to viral infections, but can develop immune-pathogenic effects and predisposition to autoimmunity due to hyper immune responses (4, 5). Sex hormones can also control the immune response via circadian rhythm. Many hormones like cortisol, known to regulate T cell mediated inflammation, have a circadian rhythm with a maximum peak at 8:00 a.m. and progressively lower levels as the day progresses (6). Interaction between sex hormones and environmental factors like cigarette smoke and infections lead to variable responses in both genders (5, 7, 8). There is emerging evidence that sex hormones impact microbial composition and the resulting immune response via secondary metabolites binding with receptors like estrogen receptors (ERs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) etc. (9). These differences in immune response can lead to variability in disease phenotypes with autoimmunity occurring more often in females and cancers occurring more in males (Figure 1).},

Plasma ORF1p shows promise for early detection of ovarian cancer, improves diagnostic performance in a multianalyte panel, provides early therapeutic response monitoring in gastroesophageal cancers, and is prognostic for overall survival in gastroesophageal and colorectal cancers.

JEPonline 2017;20(4):11-23. We investigated the effects of sex and exercise intensity on the circulating total and differential leukocyte counts after exercise in trained participants. Ten men and 10 women randomly cycled at 30, 70, or 90\% maximum workload for 30 min and then rested for 30 min, with 7 days apart. Blood samples were collected immediately before, after, and 30 min after exercise to measure leukocyte counts. Men and women had the same changes in total leukocyte and subtype counts, which returned to baseline at the end of recovery. Compared with low-intensity exercise, total leukocyte counts showed a greater increase immediately after higher intensities exercise (P{$<$}0.05 for all). The increase in the neutrophil count immediately after high-intensity was greater than that after lower intensities exercise (P{$<$}0.05). Lymphocyte count showed a greater increase at the end of low- to high-intensity exercise (P{$<$}0.05 for all). Monocyte count showed a greater increase at the end of high-intensity versus low-intensity exercise (P{$<$}0.05 for all). Changes in total leukocyte and subtypes counts depended on the exercise intensity, with the lowest values seen with low-intensity exercise; there was no effect of sex. It appears that 30 min recovery is sufficient time at all intensities for all leukocyte subtypes to return to baseline levels.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to review published studies on the variability of age at menarche and age at menopause throughout the world, and to identify the main causes for age variation in the timing of these events. We first present a summary table including mean (or median) values of the age at menarche in 67 countries, and of the age at menopause in 26 countries. General linear models showed that mean age at menarche was strongly linked to the mean female life expectancy, suggesting that one or several variables responsible for inequalities in longevity similarly influenced the onset of menarche. A closer examination of the data revealed that among several variables reflecting living conditions, the factors best explaining the variation in age at menarche were adult illiteracy rate and vegetable calorie consumption. Because adult illiteracy rate has some correlation with the age at which children are involved in physical activities that can be detrimental in terms of energy expenditure, our results suggest that age at menarche reflects more a trend in energy balance than merely nutritional status. In addition, we found the main determinant of age at menopause to be the mean fertility. This study thus suggests that, on a large scale, age at menarche is mainly determined by extrinsic factors such as living conditions, while age at menopause seems to be mainly influenced by intrinsic factors such as the reproductive history of individuals. Finally, these findings suggest that human patterns cannot be addressed solely by traditional, small-scale investigations on single populations. Rather, complementary research on a larger scale, such as this study, may be more appropriate in defining some interesting applications to the practical problems of human ecology.},

Investments in a high testosterone phenotype trade-off against other functions, particularly survival-enhancing immune function and cellular repair; thus only individuals in good condition can maintain both a high testosterone phenotype and somatic maintenance.

Human challenge hypothesis research focuses on young men in industrial populations, who have higher baseline T levels than men in subsistence populations. We tested whether the Tsimane, pathogenically stressed forager-horticulturalists of the Bolivian Amazon, would express acute T increases in response to physical competition. Saliva was collected from 88 Tsimane men (aged 16--59 years) before and after a competitive soccer match. Tsimane men had significantly lower baseline levels of T ( {$\beta$} = -0.41, p {$<$} 0.001) when compared with age-matched United States (US) males. Linear mixed-effects models were used to establish that T increased significantly immediately following competition ( {$\beta$} = 0.23, p {$<$} 0.001), remaining high 1 h later ( {$\beta$} = 0.09, p = 0.007); equivalent to 30.1 and 15.5 per cent increases in T, respectively. We did not find larger increases in T among winners ( p = 0.412), although T increases were positively associated with self-rated performance ( {$\beta$} = 9.07, p = 0.004). These results suggest that despite lower levels of T than US males, Tsimane males exhibit acute increases in T at the same relative magnitude reported by studies in industrialized settings, with larger increases in T for those who report better individual performance.},

Due to the diversity of clinical presentation regarding symptoms and disease patterns, the optimal patient care represents an enormous interdisciplinary challenge. Frequently, hypersensitivity reactions affect more than one sex hormone and double positive tests for estrogen and progesterone have been described. Since the menstrual cycle dependent symptoms range from skin afflictions, gynecological problems to non-specific reactions, different pathophysiological mechanisms seem likely. Various desensitization protocols are described as causal treatment options, but are rarely applied in clinical routine. Consequently, major research efforts with a quick translation of therapeutic interventions into clinical practice will be crucial to help affected patients in the future.},

Measurement of T-cell subsets is important in India for evaluating disease stage and progression in individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hence, this study was conducted to provide normal ranges of absolute and percentage values of CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte subsets and the ratio of CD4 to CD8 in normal Indian adults. Methods: Flow cytometric analysis (EPICS-XL) was used to determine the range of T-lymphocyte subpopulations in normal Indian blood donors at Command Hospital and the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India. The reference population consisted of 94 healthy HIV-seronegative blood donors. T-lymphocyte subsets were analyzed with two-color immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes with the use of a lysed whole-blood technique and enumerated. Results: For normal values of various blood components, we found mean values of 2114 cells/␮l for total lymphocytes, 865 cells/␮l (40.2\%) for CD4؉ lymphocytes, 552 cells/␮l (31.3\%) for CD8؉ lymphocytes, and 1.7 for the CD4:CD8 ratio. The 95\% confidence intervals for the same parameters were 1115-- 4009 cells/␮l, 430 --1740 cells/␮l (30.75-- 49.60\%), 218 --1396 cells/␮l (20.06 -- 42.52\%), and 0.39 --3.02 respectively. Females had significantly higher CD4 counts (P {$<$} 0.05), percentage of CD4 lymphocytes (P {$<$} 0.01), and CD4:CD8 ratio (P {$<$} 0.01). Males had a significantly higher percentage of CD8 lymphocytes (P {$<$} 0.01). They also had higher CD8 counts that did not reach significance. Age, ethnicity (Dravidian versus Aryan), smoking, alcohol consumption, and the interval between drawing the blood sample and its analysis were factors that did not produce statistically significant differences in the T-cell subsets studied. Conclusions: When compared with other published series, the CD4 and CD8 values in healthy Indians were no different from those reported in the West. These observations have important clinical implications for the use of T-lymphocyte subset measurements in India, especially in the management of HIV infection. The normal ranges established by this study can be used as a reference for decisions made in clinical practice. Cytometry Part B (Clin.

  abstract = {Background: Sex differences are important epidemiological factors that impact in the frequency and severity of infectious diseases. A clear sexual dimorphism in bacterial infections has been reported in both humans and animal models. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in this gender bias are just starting to be elucidated. In the present article, we aim to review the available data in the literature that report bacterial infections presenting a clear sexual dimorphism, without considering behavioral and social factors. Main body: The sexual dimorphism in bacterial infections has been mainly attributed to the differential levels of sex hormones between males and females, as well as to genetic factors. In general, males are more susceptible to gastrointestinal and respiratory bacterial diseases and sepsis, while females are more susceptible to genitourinary tract bacterial infections. However, these incidences depend on the population evaluated, animal model and the bacterial species. Female protection against bacterial infections and the associated complications is assumed to be due to the pro-inflammatory effect of estradiol, while male susceptibility to those infections is associated with the testosterone-mediated immune suppression, probably via their specific receptors. Recent studies indicate that the protective effect of estradiol depends on the estrogen receptor subtype and the specific tissue compartment involved in the bacterial insult, suggesting that tissue-specific expression of particular sex steroid receptors contributes to the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Furthermore, this gender bias also depends on the effects of sex hormones on specific bacterial species. Finally, since a large number of genes related to immune functions are located on the X chromosome, X-linked mosaicism confers a highly polymorphic gene expression program that allows women to respond with a more expanded immune repertoire as compared with men. Conclusion: Notwithstanding there is increasing evidence that confirms the sexual dimorphism in certain bacterial infections and the molecular mechanisms associated, further studies are required to clarify conflicting data and to determine the role of specific hormone receptors involved in the gender bias of bacterial infections, as well as their potential as therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Clinical studies of women from the United States demonstrate a sensitivity of the ovarian system to energetic stress. Even moderate exercise or caloric restriction can lead to lower progesterone levels and failure to ovulate. Yet women in many nonindustrial populations experience as many as a dozen pregnancies in a lifetime despite poor nutritional resources, heavy workloads, and typical progesterone levels only about two-thirds of those of U.S. women. Previous cross-sectional studies of progesterone may, however, suffer from inadvertent selection bias. In a noncontracepting population, the most fecund women, who might be expected to have the highest progesterone, are more likely to be pregnant or breastfeeding and hence unavailable for a cross-sectional study of the ovarian cycle. The present longitudinal study was designed to ascertain whether lower progesterone also characterizes conception, implantation, and gestation in women from nonindustrialized populations. We compared rural Bolivian Aymara women (n = 191) to women from Chicago (n = 29) and found that mean-peak-luteal progesterone in the ovulatory cycles of Bolivian women averaged approximately 71\% that of the women from Chicago. In conception cycles, progesterone levels in Bolivian women during the periovulatory period were approximately 63\%, and during the peri-implantation period were approximately 50\%, those of the U.S. women. These observations argue that lower progesterone levels typically characterize the reproductive process in Bolivian women and perhaps others from nonindustrialized populations. We discuss the possible proximate and evolutionary explanations for this variation and note the implications for developing suitable hormonal contraceptives and elucidating the etiology of cancers of the breast and reproductive tract.},

  abstract = {Testosterone (T) plays a key role in the increase and maintenance of muscle mass and bone density in adult men. Life history theory predicts that environmental stress may prompt a reallocation of such investments to those functions critical to survival. We tested this hypothesis in two studies of rural Bolivian adult men by comparing free T levels and circadian rhythms during late winter, which is especially severe, to those in less arduous seasons. For each pair of salivary TAM/TPM samples (collected in a {\textasciitilde}12-hour period), circadian rhythm was considered classic (CCLASSIC) if TAM{$>$}110\%TPM, reverse (CREVERSE) if TPM{$>$}110\%TAM, and flat (CFLAT) otherwise. We tested the hypotheses that mean TAM{$>$}mean TPM and that mean TLW{$<$}mean TOTHER (LW=late winter, OTHER=other seasons). In Study A, of 115 TPM-TAM pairs, 51\%=CCLASSIC, 39\%=CREVERSE, 10\%=CFLAT; in Study B, of 184 TAM-TPM pairs, 55\%=CCLASSIC, 33\%=CREVERSE, 12\%=CFLAT. Based on fitting linear mixed models, in both studies TOTHER-AM{$>$}TOTHER-PM (A: p=0.035, B: p=0.0005) and TOTHER-AM{$>$}TLW-AM (A: p=0.054, B: p=0.007); TPM did not vary seasonally, and T diurnality was not significant during late winter. T diurnality varied substantially between days within an individual, between individuals and between seasons, but neither T levels nor diurnality varied with age. These patterns may reflect the seasonally varying but unscheduled, life-long, strenuous physical labor that typifies many non-industrialized economies. These results also suggest that single morning samples may substantially underestimate peak circulating T for an individual and, most importantly, that exogenous signals may moderate diurnality and the trajectory of age-related change in the male gonadal axis.},

Results: We identified higher B-cell ELISPOT responses in females than males. Potential mechanisms for sex effects were identified in four gene clusters related to T, NK, and B cells. Mediation analysis indicated that sex-dependent expression in T and NK cell genes can be partially attributed to higher CD4+ T cell and lower NK cell fractions in females. We identified strong sex effects in 135 B cell genes whose expression correlates with ELISPOT measures, and found that cell subset differences did not explain the effect of sex on these genes' expression. Post-vaccination expression of these genes, however, mediated 41\% of the sex effect on ELISPOT responses. Conclusions: These results improve our understanding of sexual dimorphism in immunity and influenza vaccine response.},

  abstract = {Systemic autoimmune diseases are characterized by the failure of the immune system to differentiate self from non-self. These conditions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and they can affect many organs and systems, having significant clinical heterogeneity. Recent discoveries have highlighted that neutrophils, and in particular the neutrophil extracellular traps that they can release upon activation, can have central roles in the initiation and perpetuation of systemic autoimmune disorders and orchestrate complex inflammatory responses that lead to organ damage. Dysregulation of neutrophil cell death can lead to the modification of autoantigens and their presentation to the adaptive immune system. Furthermore, subsets of neutrophils that seem to be more prevalent in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders can promote vascular damage and increased oxidative stress. With the emergence of new technologies allowing for improved assessments of neutrophils, the complexity of neutrophil biology and its dysregulation is now starting to be understood. In this Review, we provide an overview of the roles of neutrophils in systemic autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases and address putative therapeutic targets that may be explored based on this new knowledge.},

  abstract = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton--Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  abstract = {Background               Pregnancy is known to induce extensive biological changes in the healthy mother. Little is known, however, about what these changes are at the molecular level. We have examined systemic expression changes in protein-coding genes and long non-coding (lnc) RNAs during and after pregnancy, compared to before pregnancy, among healthy women with term pregnancies.                                         Methods               Blood samples were collected from 14 healthy women enrolled in our prospective pregnancy cohort at 7 time-points (before, during and after pregnancy). Total RNA from frozen whole blood was used for RNA sequencing. Following raw read alignment and assembly, gene-level counts were obtained for protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs. At each time-point, cell type proportions were estimated using deconvolution. To examine associations between pregnancy status and gene expression over time, Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models were fitted, adjusting for age at conception, and with and without adjusting for changes in cell type proportions. Fold-changes in expression at each trimester were examined relative to the pre-pregnancy baseline.                                         Results               Numerous immune-related genes demonstrated pregnancy-associated expression, in a time-dependent manner. The genes that demonstrated the largest changes in expression included several that were neutrophil-related (over-expressed) and numerous immunoglobulin genes (under-expressed). Estimated cell proportions revealed a marked increase in neutrophils, and less so of activated CD4 memory T cells, during pregnancy, while most other cell type proportions decreased or remained unchanged. Adjusting for cell type proportions in our model revealed that although most of the expression changes were due to changes in cell type proportions in the bloodstream, transcriptional regulation was also involved, especially in down-regulating expression of type I interferon inducible genes.                                         Conclusion               Compared to a pre-pregnancy baseline, there were extensive systemic changes in cell type proportions, gene expression and biological pathways associated with different stages of pregnancy and postpartum among healthy women. Some were due to changes in cell type proportions and some due to gene regulation. In addition to providing insight into term pregnancy among healthy women, these findings also provide a ``normal'' reference for abnormal pregnancies and for autoimmune diseases that improve or worsen during pregnancy, to assess deviations from normal.},

  abstract = {In the review we analyzed short history of the establishment of a novel hematological parameter for systemic inflammation and stress coined as a neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Today NLR is widely used across almost all medical disciplines as a reliable and easy available marker of immune response to various infectious and non-infectious stimuli. We analyzed the immunological and biological aspects of dynamic changes of neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes in circulating blood during endocrine stress, dysbalance of autonomic nervous system and systemic inflammation. NLR reflects online dynamic relationship between innate (neutrophils) and adaptive cellular immune response (lymphocytes) during illness and various pathological states. NLR is influenced by many conditions including age, rice, medication, chronic disease like coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, psychiatric diagnosis, cancer of solid organs, anemia and stress. A normal range of NLR is between 1--2, the values higher than 3.0 and below 0.7 in adults are pathological. NLR in a grey zone between 2.3--3.0 may serve as early warning of pathological state or process such like cancer, atherosclerosis, infection, inflammation, psychiatric disorders and stress. NLR is used as a reliable and cheap marker of ongoing cancerrelated inflammation and a valid indicator of prognosis of solid tumors. Majority of meta-analyses have explored the prognostic value of NLR in various solid tumors and have found out the cut-off value of NLR above 3.0 (IQR 2.5--5.0). We summarized its privilege in oncology: NLR may be used for stratification of cancer, correlates with the tumor size, stage of tumors, metastatic potential and lymphatic invasion. NLR has independent prognostic role regarding overall, cancer free and cancer-specific survival. It is useful for monitoring oncological therapy, including biological and immune check point inhibitors treatment. NLR is a very sensitive indicator of infection, inflammation and sepsis, validated in numerous studies. Clinical research confirmed the sensitivity of NLR for diagnosis/stratification of systemic infection, sepsis, bacteremia as well as its robust predictive and prognostic value. NLR should be investigated daily, and follow-up its absolute values and dynamic course in acute disease or critical illness. The severity of critical illness, the level of stress and serious inflammation is expressed by dramatic increasing of NLR values above 11 {$\geq$} 17, or even higher than 30. Improving the clinical course of sepsis, critical illness, lower risk of mortality are associated with decline of NLR values below 7. NLR is helpful in differentiating more severe disease versus milder one. NLR is cheap, simple, fast responding and easy available parameter of stress and inflammation with high sensitivity and low specificity, it should be used routinely in emergency departments, ICUs, in acute medicine including surgery, orthopedics, traumatology, cardiology, neurology, psychiatry and even oncology. Dynamic changes of NLR precede the clinical state for several hours and may warn clinicians about the ongoing pathological process early. NLR is a novel perspective marker of cellular immune activation, a valid index of stress and systemic inflammation, which open a new dimension for clinical medicine, for better understanding of the biology of inflammation, coupling and antagonism between innate and adaptive immunity and its clinical consequences for health and disease (Tab. 8, Fig. 3, Ref. 151).

  abstract = {Objectives: The age of menopause is affected by several factors. In this study we aimed to identify the age of natural menopause and its related factors in a large-scale population-based cohort in Iran. Methods: In this study, a subset of data collected during the enrollment phase of the Tabari cohort study was utilized. Reproductive history and other related data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were obtained from all participants. Data were analyzed using chi-square test, independent t test, and ANOVA as well as a multivariate linear regression model. Results: Among participants of the Tabari cohort, 2,753 were menopausal women. The mean age of natural and induced menopause was 49.2 {\textpm} 4.7 and 43.2 {\textpm} 6.4 years, respectively (P = 0.001). The number of pregnancies, duration of breastfeeding, level of education, residency, presence of thyroid disease, and body mass index affected the age of menopause. After adjustments for confounding variables, the number of pregnancies remained significantly associated with late menopause. Conclusions: The age of natural menopause in this study was similar to that in other studies, and the number of pregnancies was positively associated with the age of menopause after adjustments for confounding variables.},

  abstract = {Background               The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is recognized as a biomarker for systemic inflammation and immune activation. However, its connection with the mortality risk in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between NLR and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk in U.S. adults with RA.                                         Methods               Data were gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles spanning 1999 to March 2020. We included adults aged {$\geq$}20 years. The NLR was computed by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count from complete blood counts. The maximally selected rank statistics method helped identify the optimal NLR cutoff value associated with significant survival outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to investigate the relationship between the NLR and the all-cause and cardiovascular mortality of RA. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were utilized to detect whether there were linear or non-linear relationships between NLR and mortality.                                         Results               In this study, 2002 adults with RA were included, with 339 having a higher NLR ({$\geq$}3.28) and 1663 having a lower NLR (\&lt;3.28). During a median follow-up of 84 months, 79 RA individuals died. Participants with higher NLR had a 2-fold increased risk of all-cause (HR = 2.02, 95\% CI: 1.53-2.66) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 2.48, 95\% CI: 1.34-4.57) versus lower NLR, after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the survival rate for the higher NLR group was significantly lower than the lower NLR group, in terms of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (both P\&lt;0.0001). The RCS curve demonstrated a positive linear association between the NLR and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.                                         Conclusion               A higher NLR was independently predictive of elevated long-term mortality risk in U.S. adults with RA. The NLR may serve as an inexpensive, widely available prognostic marker in RA.},

  abstract = {Immune defense often differs between the sexes, with males often having a weaker response, at least among many vertebrates. We examined encapsulation ability, a cell-mediated immune response, in laboratory and field populations of two species of field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus (Le Guillou, 1841) and Teleogryllus commodus (Walker, 1869), which have different life histories. In the seasonally breeding T. commodus, males show a stronger encapsulation response than females in both the laboratory and the field, although the difference is more marked under field conditions. The aseasonal T. oceanicus showed no sex difference in encapsulation in either field or laboratory samples fed ad libitum, but when food was experimentally reduced, the same pattern of stronger male response emerged. It is possible that this pattern may result from selection on females to increase investment in reproduction when time and energy for breeding are limited, as is more likely for seasonal breeders or animals under food restriction.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in parasite infection rates, intensities, or population patterns are common in a wide range of taxa. These differences are usually attributed to 1 of 2 causes: (1) ecological (sociological in humans); and (2) physiological, usually hormonal in origin. Examples of the first cause include differential exposure to pathogens because of sex-specific behavior or morphology. The second cause may stem from the well-documented association between testosterone and the immune system; sexually mature male vertebrates are often more susceptible to infection and carry higher parasite burdens in the field. Although many researchers favor one explanation over the other, the requisite controlled experiments to rule out confounding variables are often neglected. We suggest that sex differences in disease have evolved just as sex differences in morphology and behavior, and are the result of selection acting differently on males and females. Research has often focused on proximate mechanistic explanations for the sex differences in infection rates, but it is equally important to understand the generality of the patterns in an evolutionary context. Because males potentially gain more than females by taking risks and engaging in competition, sexual selection pressure has shaped male behavior and appearance to maximize competitive ability and attractiveness. Many of the classic male attributes such as antlers on deer are testosterone-dependent, putting males in what appears to be a cruel bind: become vulnerable to disease by developing an attractive secondary sexual ornament, or risk lowered mating success by reducing it. A variety of hypotheses have been put forward to explain why males have not circumvented this dilemma. The mating system of the host species will influence the likelihood of sex differences in parasite infection, because males in monogamous species are subject to weaker sexual selection than males in polygynous species. Whether these evolutionary generalizations apply to invertebrates, which lack testosterone, remains to be seen.},
